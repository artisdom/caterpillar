# Tasks

- Print error location with error message
- Prevent shadowing between functions and bindings
- Simplify tokenizer
  There are a few too many edge cases for my taste.
- Add support for nested modules
- Add support for namespaces and tie those to modules
- Don't require whitespace in front of `.`
