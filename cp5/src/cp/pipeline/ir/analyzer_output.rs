// This representation omits module, function, and test definitions, because the
// evaluator (which is the consumer of this representation) doesn't need them.
// This might be a problem.
//
// The idea is to have this be the canonical representation of the code. This
// representation will be stored in some kind of "system image", and the human-
// readable representation will be generated on the fly, whenever the developer
// looks at a function.
//
// Not having important parts of the language as part of the canonical
// representation seems like an obvious no-go at first, but it *could* actually
// work.
//
// A normal language doesn't need a representation of the file that the source
// code is defined in, because the concept of files exists "below" the actual
// language. It's something the editor needs to know about, not the language
// itself.
//
// In much the same way, the concept of a function could exist below the rest of
// the language in Caterpillar. It's the unit of organization, a thing that the
// system image and the editor need to understand, but not the language itself.
// The language itself needs to understand that functions exist and can be
// called, but it doesn't need to represent function definitions. The same
// thinking can be applied to modules and tests.
//
// However, handling it like this would create limitations. It would not be
// possible to have nested function definitions (because how would you represent
// the outer function then). Same goes for modules that have anything in them
// but function definitions (so no compile-time code that you can just write
// into a module).
//
// Maybe these limitations are fine, at first. Or maybe the solution is to
// broaden this representation beyond just what's needed by the evaluator. Maybe
// it makes most sense long-term, if there is a more general canonical
// representation, and the evaluator is just one of several consumers that only
// care about a subset.
//
// If there was a more general canonical representation, then this would
// probably not be it. Instead, this could be reframed as the set of events that
// the analyzer emits, and those events would be aggregated to build up the new
// canonical representation.
