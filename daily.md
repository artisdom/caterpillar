# Daily Thoughts

These are my daily thoughts on Caterpillar. If you have any questions, comments,

I've been working on Caterpillar for over a year now, sinking countless hours
into it. So far, I've seen it as a side project. With long-term potential, yes,
but mostly as something to learn from and have fun with.

This perspective is starting to change. I'm starting to take the project more
seriously. As a result of that, I'd like to talk about it more. And I figure, if
I want to do so consistently, a daily cadence (mostly) is probably easiest to
sustain.

This is an experiment. I don't know for how long I will want to keep doing it.
And so I'm starting small, with just a file in the repository. If this turns
into something real later on, I can take it to a website, an email newsletter,
maybe social media.
