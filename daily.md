# Daily Thoughts

These are my daily thoughts on Caterpillar. If you have any questions, comments,

I sometimes have this tendency to overthink and overplan. Projects that should
have been quick experiments get delayed again and again, then wrapped up in a
grandiose strategy, before I finally get started. More than once, that grandiose
strategy then turned out to be a mistake. At that point, I was committed. The
project felt too important to just abandon.

I'm glad that I (maybe accidentally) chose the opposite strategy with
Caterpillar. It's been all about prototypes and learning from the start. And
I've never been shy to throw away any of those prototypes to just start fresh
with a new approach.

I'm doing again a similar thing again, with this new format. Start small and,
more importantly, get started. Then learn, correct, or abandon. Whatever turns
out to be appropriate.

I've been working on Caterpillar for over a year now, sinking countless hours
into it. So far, I've seen it as a side project. With long-term potential, yes,
but mostly as something to learn from and have fun with.

This perspective is starting to change. I'm starting to take the project more
seriously. As a result of that, I'd like to talk about it more. And I figure, if
I want to do so consistently, a daily cadence (mostly) is probably easiest to
sustain.

This is an experiment. I don't know for how long I will want to keep doing it.
And so I'm starting small, with just a file in the repository. If this turns
into something real later on, I can take it to a website, an email newsletter,
maybe social media.
