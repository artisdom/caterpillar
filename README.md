# Caterpillar

## About

The goal of the Caterpillar project is to explore the practical use of
[interactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_programming).

You can find the currently active prototype in the [`capi/` directory](capi/).
The [`archive/` directory](archive/) contains a number of previous prototypes at
various levels of completion.

## Design

I'm currently working on collecting the ideas that have been guiding me into a
rough design document: [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md)

But please don't read too much into that. This project has already gone through
a large number of prototypes, and I'm sure it will go through more. My ideas
have changed significantly during that time, and they will keep evolving.

At some point, I hope to develop one of these prototypes into a productive
language. The only design that is really relevant is the one implemented in
that.
