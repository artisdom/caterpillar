# Caterpillar

## About

Caterpillar is an experimental language that aims to explore interactive
programming.

## Status & Organization

Caterpillar is still in a state of early exploration. It's far from being
usable for anything yet.

The project is organized as a series of prototypes, each labeled `cp<n>`, where
`<n>` is a sequential integer. Check out the top-level directory for currently
active prototypes, and the [`archive/`](archive/) directory for completed or
abandoned ones.
