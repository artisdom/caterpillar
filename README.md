# Caterpillar

[**Daily Thoughts**](daily.md)

## Vision

**Caterpillar is a programming language** with a dual goal:

- Create an **immediate connection to the code you're writing**, to give you an
  intuitive understanding of what it's doing.
- Bring this experience to many places: browsers, servers, desktops, phones,
  watches, microcontrollers; CPUs and GPUs.

Caterpillar aims to achieve this via **interactive programming**; the practice
of directly manipulating your running program, instead of going through an
extended loop of re-compiling, re-starting, then navigating to where you can
test your change.

## Status

Caterpillar is still early-stage and experimental. It can hardly be called a
language right now. Development is focused on creating a basic solution for one
use case (game development) on one platform (browsers).

Caterpillar has gone through [a series of prototypes](archive/), of varying
levels of sophistication, each of which provided answers to different questions.
The [current prototype](capi/) explores whether an early focus on tooling is a
practical approach.

You can keep up with the project reading my
[daily thoughts](https://capi.hannobraun.com/daily), which include development
updates.

## Design

I'm currently working on collecting the ideas that have been guiding me into a
rough design document: [design.md](design.md)

But please don't read too much into that. This project has already gone through
a large number of prototypes, and I'm sure it will go through more. My ideas
have changed significantly during that time, and they will keep evolving.

At some point, I hope to develop one of these prototypes into a productive
language. The only design that is really relevant is the one implemented in
that.
