# Caterpillar

## About

The goal of the Caterpillar project is to explore the practical use of
[interactive programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_programming).

You can find the currently active prototype at the top level of this repository
(or, at the time of writing, you actually can't, because I'm back at the drawing
board). The [`archive/` directory](archive/) contains a number of previous
prototypes at various levels of completion.
