# Caterpillar

[**Daily Thoughts**](daily.md)

## About

The goal of the Caterpillar project is to create a **programming language** that
gives you a **immediate connection to the code** you're writing, enabling an
**intuitive understanding** of the program that you're working on.

The method for achieving this is **interactive programming**, the **direct
manipulation of a running program**, instead of going through an extended loop
of re-compiling, re-starting, and re-finding the right location in your program
where you can test the change you made.

Caterpillar is still early-stage and experimental. This goal has not nearly been
achieved yet. I'm incrementally approaching this long-term vision through a
series of practical prototypes with specific, short-term goals.

You can find the currently active prototype in the [`capi/` directory](capi/).
The [`archive/` directory](archive/) contains a number of previous prototypes at
various levels of completion.

## Design

I'm currently working on collecting the ideas that have been guiding me into a
rough design document: [design.md](design.md)

But please don't read too much into that. This project has already gone through
a large number of prototypes, and I'm sure it will go through more. My ideas
have changed significantly during that time, and they will keep evolving.

At some point, I hope to develop one of these prototypes into a productive
language. The only design that is really relevant is the one implemented in
that.
