/// # The types that were inferred in the code
///
/// ## Separation of Types from `Function`
///
/// This stores not only the types themselves, but associates them with
/// fragments, branches, and functions. It is necessary to store the types
/// separately like this.
///
/// When type inference happens, functions must have been resolved already. If
/// the inferred types were then stored within `Function` (which includes
/// `Branch` and `Fragment`), the hash of the function would change, making the
/// previous function resolution invalid.
///
/// This might raise the question, whether it's okay to exclude the types from
/// the hash. And the answer is yes, that's perfectly fine. Type inference is
/// deterministic. It can only change if anything else about the function (which
/// would be included in the hash) changes first.
///
/// ## Implementation Note
///
/// This type refers to fragments, branches, and hashes by location. This is a
/// bit dubious, as a code update could put a different function in that
/// location, and then it wouldn't be possible to have type information for both
/// the old and new versions of the function.
///
/// Right now, this is fine. All calls to a function are updated when the
/// function is updated. So it's not necessary to keep type information for old
/// versions of functions.
///
/// But eventually, it will be possible for code to still call old versions of
/// functions (so refactorings can happen in smaller steps, for example). Then
/// referring to functions by location is no longer any good.
///
/// For now, referring to functions by hash here would cause too many problems
/// though. While referring to a function itself by hash should be easy, we'd
/// also need equivalents of `BranchLocation` and `FragmentLocation` that refer
/// to the function by hash instead of location.
