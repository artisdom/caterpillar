    /// # Insert fragment, detecting replaced fragments
    ///
    /// If this fragment replaced another one, that information is stored, and
    /// can later be retrieved via [`Fragments::take_replacements`].
    ///
    /// ## Algorithm
    ///
    /// The insertion itself is straight-forward: The fragment is inserted into
    /// a map, indexed by its ID (and also a second map, indexed by its
    /// address). Done.
    ///
    /// Detecting replacements is non-trivial, however. Let's consider some
    /// examples, starting with a simple one:
    ///
    /// ``` ignore
    /// b a -> c a
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Here, the letters are placeholders for fragments, while `->` separates
    /// the old version of the example code (on the left) from the new version
    /// (on the right).
    ///
    /// Here, `c` replaces `b`, which is rather straight-forward to detect. They
    /// have the same `parent` (as both are in the same context), and they are
    /// both followed by the same `next` element, `a`. As a result, they have
    /// the same address. Hence, checking if there already was a fragment at the
    /// the new fragment's address is the first step in detecting a replacement.
    ///
    /// But by itself, this is not enough. Let's consider this slightly more
    /// complicated case:
    ///
    /// ``` ignore
    /// c b a -> e d a
    /// ```
    ///
    /// Here, `b` is replaced by `d`. Even if `c` stays the same on a syntactic
    /// level, it has a new `next` fragment, and thus must become a new fragment
    /// itself. Hence, `c` is replaced by `e`.
    ///
    /// The replacement `b` -> `d` is again trivially detected by the address
    /// lookup step. But this won't detect the replacement `c` -> `e`. Their
    /// `next` fragments differ (they are `b` and `d`, respectively), meaning
    /// they have different addresses.
    ///
    /// So what can we do? Since syntax is analyzed (and hence, fragments are
    /// created) right-to-left, the replacement `b` -> `d` is already known by
    /// the point we consider the replacement `c` -> `e`. We can use this
    /// knowledge to update the address of `e`. After that update, we can find
    /// the replacement using another address lookup.
    ///
    /// Let's take a closer look at what happens, step by step. Since all the
    /// fragments in this example have the same parent, we'll ignore that part
    /// of the address, for the sake of simplicity. In the implementation, the
    /// `parent` is handled exactly the same as the `next` fragment.
    ///
    /// 1. Insert `a` at address `next: none`
    ///    1. no fragment already at address `next: none`
    ///    2. no `next` fragment available
    /// 2. Insert `b` at address `next: a`
    ///    1. no fragment already at address `next: a`
    ///    2. no known replacements of `a`
    /// 3. Insert `c` at address `next: b`
    ///    1. no fragment already at address `next: b`
    ///    2. no known replacements of `b`
    ///
    /// At this point, our initial script (`c b a`) has been fully analyzed and
    /// is running. Now the user makes a change to the original code, resulting
    /// in more fragments being inserted.
    ///
    /// 4. Insert `a` at address `next: none`
    ///    1. fragment `a` at address `next: none` is identical; no replacement
    ///    2. no `next` fragment available
    /// 5. Insert `d` at address `next: a`
    ///    1. fragment `b` at address `next: a`; note replacement `b` -> `d`
    ///    2. no known replacements of `a`
    /// 6. Insert `e` at address `next: d`
    ///    1. no fragment already at address `next: d`
    ///    2. `d` is known to replace `b`; substitute address to `next: b`
    ///    3. fragment `c` at address `next: b`; note replacement `c` -> `e`
    ///
    /// And that's it! We've detected both replacements (`b` -> `d` and `c` ->
    /// `e`). This scales up to more complicated cases, requiring more
    /// substitutions of the address each time.
