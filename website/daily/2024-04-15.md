Writing daily is awesome. I feel myself constantly immersed in Caterpillar, the
topic I'm writing about. When I write weekly or monthly, there's always this
hurdle. It can be difficult to get into again.

Not so with daily writing! The ideas just flow, and the list of future topic
keeps growing day by day. This requires a setup to capture ideas, and I'm using
[Joplin] to do that (I sync the notes between my devices with [Syncthing]). And
since ideas come whenever, wherever, I find myself writing on my phone a lot.
Something I've never enjoyed before, but that works surprisingly well.

This makes me want a full programming environment on my phone. Even if just for
quickly demonstrating something on the go. It will be a while before I can
provide something like that for Caterpillar, but I'd love to have it some day.
