Okay, so language servers, as commonly deployed today,
[are missing features that I'd like to have](/daily/2024-09-15). What are those?
I already mentioned interactivity, which is the core premise of Caterpillar. But
the ideas I have go beyond that.

Having an immediate connection to your code requires seeing what the code is
doing. Displaying code and data as text can be part of that. But I don't think
it's enough. In [another project][Fornjot], I work quite a bit with geometry. I
know that looking at textual representations of vectors and other geometric
concepts can be quite the pain.

This means the tooling should be able to render data types not only as text, but
in 2D, 3D, audio, or whatever form makes the most sense for the specific data
type. And the language should provide infrastructure to support this, just like
many languages provide infrastructure to support rendering data types as text.
