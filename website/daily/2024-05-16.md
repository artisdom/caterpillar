When it comes to Caterpillar, I think about my priorities in terms of goals and
risks. I want to create a better way to develop software. I've chosen to explore
interactive programming as the means for doing that. So what are the biggest
risks, that would prevent me from achieving this goal?

Right now, I think the biggest risk is that I fiddle around endlessly, making
progress and feeling productive, without necessarily ending up with something
useful. So I've decided to focus down on a single use case, a simple game, and
only do what is necessary to make writing that game in Caterpillar possible.

The game runs natively on my local machine, because that was easiest to get
started with. That means even a finished and fun game won't curb that top risk,
because a game running just on my computer is still not really useful. So I
think the next step after the game is finished, might be to make it run in the
browser.
