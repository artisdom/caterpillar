So what were [the problems with `if`](/daily/2024-08-12) that led me to
[pattern matching](/daily/2024-08-13)? There are two: Call stack reconstruction
and linear types. Let's start with linear types, because to get to call stack
reconstruction, we need more background.

Okay, so a value of a linear type [can only be used once](/daily/2024-07-09),
meaning if we want to use it in a closure, the closure needs to take ownership.
That means we can't have two closures using the same value. (_If_ the value is
of a linear type. Not all types have to be linear.)

So if we model `if` as a built-in function with two closure parameters, then
both can't take ownership of the same linear value. It would be fine in
principle, because only one of them gets executed, but the compiler doesn't know
that. To the compiler, a built-in function is opaque.
