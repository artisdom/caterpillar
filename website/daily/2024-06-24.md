Caterpillar allows you to [bind values to names](/daily/2024-06-23). You can
also bind multiple values in one go.

Here's some pseudocode to demonstrate that (remember,
[Caterpillar has no syntax yet][Caterpillar code]):

```
5 2 divide_integers => result remainder .
```

Here, we call a function that returns two values, and bind them both to names in
a single binding operation. In fact, we _have to_ bind them both. We are not
allowed to leave any unnamed operands behind. That would currently result in a
runtime error.

This rule improves the clarity of the code and prevents mistakes, as you can't
accidentally carry over any unnamed operands to the next operation. Maybe this
is too limiting and will change in the future, but for now, that's how it works.
