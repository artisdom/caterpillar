Caterpillar has a stack-based evaluation model. But despite that,
[functions have to specify named arguments](/daily/2024-06-22). In addition, you
can bind values to names within a function.

Here's some pseudocode (because again,
[Caterpillar still has no syntax][Caterpillar code]):

```
fn square_then_times_five ( x )
{
	x x * => squared .
	squared 5 * => times_five .
	times_five
}
```

Here, each intermediate result is bound to a name. In most languages, this would
be called a "variable", but in Caterpillar they are called "bindings". (Because
they are supposed to be immutable, i.e. not actually _variable_.)
