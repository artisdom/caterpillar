I think eventually, I want to build a custom editor for Caterpillar. Maybe
that's stupid and unrealistic. Even if I build one, it might just be an
intermediate step towards full-featured support in existing IDEs.

But Caterpillar is definitely [not a traditional language](/daily/2024-09-13).
And I want to go quite far with what the tooling provides to the developer. I
think extending an existing IDE would be quite the pain. And especially while we
still figure out what the tooling needs to be like, a custom editor might be a
better vehicle for experimentation.

We'll see. For now, we have the debugger. The code it displays is already based
on an intermediate representation from the compiler, which I've designed with a
code database in mind. That's the starting point. Maybe it will be quite natural
to slowly extend that with editing capability here or there, until it can take
over as a primary driver during development.
