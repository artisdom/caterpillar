So, about running Caterpillar in the browser. What I _was going to_ write about
today, is the approach I've chosen for making that happen. I considered other
approaches too, and I would have presented those in the following days. Weighing
their pros and cons, convincing you (and myself!) that I've made the right
choice. I could have talked about that for weeks, probably!

All of that has been overtaken by events, because I'm already done:

<video controls>
    <source src="2024-06-08/snake-and-debugger-in-the-browser.webm" />
</video>

(You can't see my mouse pointer in the video, unfortunately. What I'm doing
there at the end, is clicking "Stop", "Continue", and "Reset" a few times, to
demonstrate the debugger.)

I just mashed everything (game, debugger, all language infrastructure) into a
single web page. I figured that would be the quickest option, and it's good to
know that I was right for once. Eventually, we'll need more sophisticated
infrastructure, to deploy the game and debugger separately, for example. But for
now this will do.
