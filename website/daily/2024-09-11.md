Another performance-related aspect that could
[benefit from inference and the code database](/daily/2024-09-10): data layout.
If you define a struct, a compiler might re-order its fields for better
performance. I don't have room to go into the reasons for that here, but if
you're interested, [this talk by Andrew Kelley](https://vimeo.com/649009599) is
great.

This reordering, while beneficial, is also problematic. It means that you can't
rely on a struct's layout, which is relevant for storage, communication, even
function calls. But again, what if layout optimization happens in
pre-compilation, and the already optimized struct gets stored in the database
(where it is [addressed by a hash](/daily/2024-08-01))?

The developer would see right in the code what the compiler did. And in any
situations where we exchange the struct with another entity that might have a
different version of it, whatever tooling is involved can recognize the
incompatibility, maybe even fix it, as long as type information is available.
