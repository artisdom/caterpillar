Languages that predominantly employ postfix operators, use a stack-based
evaluation model. I talked about this yesterday. To the best of my knowledge,
this stack-based model is inherent to postfix operators. At least I can't come
up with an alternative, nor can I find examples of languages that use postfix
notation, but no stack.

What I find surprising though, is how closely these languages adhere to the
stack-based model. Languages that emphasize prefix and infix operators are not
completely based around, and allow direct manipulation of, their respective
model (although that sounds like an interesting experiment).

But languages that focus on postfix operators often display a particular purity.
Other means of defining data flow, like named variables, are either strongly
discouraged or not part of the language at all. And I think this might be to
their detriment. Employing postfix operators within a more traditional
structure, with expressions, statements, and variables, is possibly a better
direction.
