When you create new bindings in Caterpillar (or "variables", as they are often
called in other languages), you modify the current scope.
[I'm intrigued by the thought of not allowing that](/daily/2024-06-26), and
instead creating a new scope every time you create a binding. (This is how
functional languages tend to do it.)

Here's an idea for how that could look:

```
a b + => x
    { x x * }
```

We have an expression, `a b +`, we bind the result of that expression to the
name `x`, and then we can use that `x` in a new scope that the binding operation
creates (the code between `{}`).

If there was much more code within that block, we wouldn't need to read all of
it to understand the `x x *` expression, because none of that other code could
change what `x` is. I have little practical experience with languages that work
like that, but it seems like this could contribute to making code easier to
understand.
