Okay, so let's get back to conditionals. I [implemented `if`](/daily/2024-07-24)
a while ago, and then [found some shortcomings](/daily/2024-08-08) that made me
want to [switch to a different solution](/daily/2024-08-10). This turned out to
be unnecessary, probably, but was an improvement anyway.

So what are the shortcomings of `if`? Well, for reasons of simplicity and
elegance, I've implemented it as a built-in function. Basically, `if` is just
like any other function. You pass it a conditional value and two closures (one
for the "then" case, one for "else"), and then the built-in `if` function
figures out which one of those to call.

But built-in functions are opaque to the compiler. All it knows, is that we
created two closures and passed those to a built-in function, with no way to
know what it's going to do with them. This leads to multiple problems. I'll
explain those later. First, I want to introduce the alternative solution I've
implemented, pattern matching in function definitions.
