People have told me, in the context of other projects, that I have to take into
account feature X or Y from day one, because it will be impossible to retrofit
later. I'm sure people will tell me the same about Caterpillar, eventually. And
I think they would be wrong.

Now let me be clear: It totally would be better if I _could_ consider all
relevant design decisions from the beginning. But there are so many open
questions, so much to figure out, that it's just impossible to juggle all of it.
I just _have_ to defer some decisions, or I'd get nothing done,

Will that lead to problems down the line? Yes, absolutely. But is all hope lost,
if I ignore certain things early on? No, I don't buy that. It might require
partial rewrites, a lengthy refactoring process, a new version that looks very
different from earlier ones. But there's always a way out.
