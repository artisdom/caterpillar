I've been talking about risks, and how they guide my development priorities.
Today, I'd like to talk about a few things that I don't consider relevant risks.

I want Caterpillar to have a static type system, that prevents most bugs from
being possible. To provide powerful compile-time meta-programming. To be highly
performant, with zero-overhead abstractions. To run everywhere: browsers,
servers, desktops, phones, watches, microcontrollers; CPUs and GPUs.

It is totally unclear if either of those goals will work out. But that doesn't
make them risks to the success of the project. Because a dynamically typed,
interpreted language that's suitable for browser games, and helps you gain an
intuitive understanding of your code; that would already be a big success.
