I've been going on for a bit about how a code database can apply to specific
aspects of Caterpillar. I've said it before, but the inspiration for the code
database comes from [Unison] (and to a lesser extent [Smalltalk]). And Unison
gets a lot out of the way they implement this, that I haven't mentioned so far.

In Unison, code is content-addressed. Meaning each piece of code is hashed, and
referenced via this hash. This approach has a lot of advantages. The Unison
documentation already does a good job of explaining that, but over the next few
days, I'd like to go over some of those advantages, and how I think they apply
to Caterpillar.

And by the way, while Caterpillar doesn't have a code database yet, it already
implements the hashing and content-addressing. This has turned out to be useful
for implementing interactive programming (as demonstrated by a previous
prototype), and I've recently re-implemented it in the current version.
