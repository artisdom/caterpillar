A while ago, I started talking about [tail call elimination](/daily/2024-08-09),
before I [got distracted](/daily/2024-08-10) and spent the next weeks talking
about (and implementing!) [pattern-matching functions](/daily/2024-08-17)
instead.

So, Caterpillar does tail call elimination, happily omitting useless stack
frames left and right. That's great! But what if your program hits a breakpoint,
or some error condition? You would expect to see where that error happened,
where the function was called from, where _that_ function was called from, and
so forth.

But where is the debugger supposed to get that information from? Well, the call
stack. The same call stack that is full of gaps, thanks to tail call
elimination. And showing information that's full of gaps is going to confuse the
developer, which won't do. The solution to that problem is call stack
reconstruction, and that's what I'd like to tackle next.
