There are many trade-offs in language design. Here's one example: Do you favor
explicitness, which makes it more obvious what's going on, hence making code
easier to read; or implicitness, which reduces the amount of code you need, thus
making it easier to write.

I want to try and sidestep this trade-off in Caterpillar, by explicitly
designing it to be used (and read) with tooling. If that works out like I hope,
we'll get ease of writing _and_ ease of reading, because everything can be
implicit and inferred, but still clearly visible in the code as you work with
it.

But that's just a different trade-off, and you pay for that one by making
Caterpillar less readable where tool support is missing. Like when you read code
on a site like GitHub. I think the upside of designing the language with tooling
in mind will be worth it, but we'll have to see where exactly to draw the line.
