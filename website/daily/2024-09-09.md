There are other interesting things you can do with
[`comptime` in Zig](/daily/2024-09-07). It also lets you control which parts of
your code get evaluated at compile-time.

I _was going to_ to say, that we don't need this in Caterpillar. We can just
guarantee that everything that _can_ happen at compile-time _does_ happen at
compile-time. And then [make that explicit](/daily/2024-07-21) using
Caterpillar's tooling. But now I'm not so sure.

I think this might work for many programs, but if you're working on some one-off
calculation that you'd like to later run on a powerful machine, then this could
get very inconvenient. You'd need some way to control this behavior, and eagerly
doing stuff at compile-time would be the wrong default. Not sure what the answer
is here. I think it's fine to defer this question until later.
