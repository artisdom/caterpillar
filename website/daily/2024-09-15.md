So why do I want [a custom editor](/daily/2024-09-14)? The core goal of
Caterpillar is to create an immediate connection between the developer and their
code. Just the language, the compiler and runtime, can't achieve that by
themselves. They need to be assisted by tools that are built around them.

The custom tooling that I imagine would be kind of a hybrid between an editor
and a debugger. Something that gives you the means to edit your code, but then
also loads that code into the running program immediately, and shows you what is
happening as the result of your changes.

I think language servers, as currently implemented for common languages and
IDEs, already get us part of the way there. But aside from the interactivity
aspect, the direct manipulation of a running program, there are things that
language servers (as far as I've seen) don't currently provide, which I want to
have.
