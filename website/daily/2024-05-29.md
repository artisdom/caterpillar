There is this seemingly widespread belief, that _if_ you're going to need
breaking changes, you better put them all into a single release. One big 2.0
version, with long periods stability before and after.

I never understood that. Seriously, I'm completely baffled by this concept.
Upgrading to such a release is a big task. And there's probably no practical way
to do it incrementally. It's one huge, all-or-nothing change; probably all over
your code base. That's the opposite of how I write software, for so many
reasons.

Instead, why wouldn't we do your best to trickle those changes out slowly, in
small pieces. Maybe start with a deprecation. Give users time to upgrade to the
new thing. Make every release "breaking", in a way, but never break anything
that hasn't been deprecated for a while.
