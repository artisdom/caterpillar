Besides types and effects, there's more about Caterpillar code that the tooling
could infer. Let's look at Rust for a moment: It has a distinction between
supposedly cheap (and hence implicit) copies, and potentially expensive (and
hence explicit) clones. (This
[doesn't work perfectly and might get changed](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2024/06/21/claim-auto-and-otherwise/),
but we can ignore that here.)

This distinction makes sense, and we might or might not end up having something
like that in Caterpillar. If we end up not having it, we could get the same
effect (or maybe even do better) by inferring and displaying information about
performance characteristics of your code.

Imaging looking at a function, and having each expression color-coded, based on
their relative cost. This could be based on heuristics, or actual measurements.
Either way, it's another example of the principle I've been talking about:
Designing the language with tooling in mind allows us to make certain things
explicit, without requiring the developer to actually write them out.
