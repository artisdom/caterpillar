So, what are the
[advantages of a content-addressed code database](/daily/2024-08-01), and how do
they apply to Caterpillar?

One of them is reduced build times. The code database serves as a perfect cache,
so there's no need to redo any analysis (like type checking) that has been done
before. That is only necessary for code that has actually changed. Likewise, you
only need to run tests for code that has changed.

Also, there are no dependency conflicts. Remember, code is referenced by hash,
not by name. It's perfectly alright to depend on multiple versions of the same
function or type. This is useful for refactoring. It means that if you change
something that a lot of code depends on, you don't have to update your whole
codebase at once. You can do that incrementally, at your leisure.
