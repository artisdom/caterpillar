Every aspect of Caterpillar that's different from more common approaches used in
mainstream languages, is going to create a hurdle that hampers adoption. That
means, if that feature doesn't provide enough of a benefit, it's not going to be
worth it on balance.

Maybe the day will come, when I have to admit that many of my ideas for
Caterpillar are too wild. And maybe then, I will start to reign the language in.
Adopt a more familiar syntax, for example; something like Rust or Python.

We'll see. Before that happens though, I want to have the opportunity to
discover better solutions. Just giving up in advance, choosing a more
conservative approach from the beginning, seems defeatist. I want to at least
have the chance to make more than an incremental improvement over the status
quo.
