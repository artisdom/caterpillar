I plan to develop Caterpillar to the point that I prefer it over other options,
independently of my desire to improve it further. That introduces its own risk:
I might create a product that only I like, but that nobody else will want to
use.

But I'm not too worried about that. I don't think I'm that special, that my
tastes and preferences are truly unique. And of course my personal seal of
approval isn't the last word. Once others start using the language (or try to),
I can incorporate their feedback.

However, having something that I genuinely want to use, will hopefully be a
strong start. I think adjusting course from there, to make the language more
palatable to others, will be more productive than trying to please everybody in
the first place.
