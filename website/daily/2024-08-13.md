[To replace `if`](/daily/2024-08-12), I've implemented pattern matching in
function definitions. What does that mean? Well, pattern matching is a feature
in many programming languages that allows you to look at a value, and then
decide what to do, based on what the value is. Here's a basic example in Rust:

```rust
let message = match n {
    0 => "We have nothing!",
    1 => "We have one!",
    _ => "We have many!",
};
```

This is just a simple example to demonstrate the concept. More advanced matching
is possible, but I won't go into that right now.

There's a neat thing that some functional languages support: Pattern matching in
function definitions. Here's the same example using that technique (in a
fictional pseudo-code, because Caterpillar still has no syntax, nor strings):

```
fn 0 to_message:
    "We have nothing!"

fn 1 to_message:
    "We have one!"

fn _ to_message:
    "We have many!"
```

Here, instead of doing pattern matching _within_ a function, we create three
functions, each called `to_message`, that have a pattern in their parameter
lists. The pattern matching happens when we call the functions; then the right
one is selected based on the argument. So the call `0 to_message` would call the
first function, `1 to_message` would call the second.
