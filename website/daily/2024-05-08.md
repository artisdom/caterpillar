I've been explaining and justifying why I'm using postfix operators in
Caterpillar. I feel pretty good about this decision, but of course, it's not
without trade-offs. First and foremost, postfix operators are unfamiliar, and
will for that reason be off-putting to many. This can hurt adoption.

But I think there needs to be a balance. Diverging from established and familiar
practices, provides the opportunity to create something better than what we
already have. Which provides reasons for adoption in the first place.

And we have to keep in mind, Caterpillar is still very experimental, and no
decision is permanent. If postfix operators turn out to be a huge mistake, I can
redesign the syntax, while keeping the parts of the language and runtime that
work. If specific features and use cases are hampered by postfix operators, it's
possible to augment the language with prefix syntax where necessary.
