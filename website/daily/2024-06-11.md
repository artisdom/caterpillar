So, how am I going to implement interactive programming?

I already had it working in a [previous prototype], where I built a system of
content-addressed code fragments. Every piece of code had a hash that identified
it (and its position in the script) uniquely. Based on that, I was able to
create a not-too-complicated algorithm to substitute updated code at runtime,
while leaving program state intact.

Unless I come up with something better on the way, I intend to just use that
same approach again. There's one difference this time: The code runs in the
browser, but it's edited outside of that. Updates have to be sent through a
development server. Another difference is, now that code is running a game.
Which I expect to (eventually) run at 60 frames per second and beyond.
