So,
[code could get auto-parallelized in the pre-compilation step](/daily/2024-07-30).
I'm not sure if that's a good idea, but it certainly is a fascinating one.
Anyway, if it were to happen, some open questions would need to be addressed.
For example, to make a _good_ decision on what to parallelize, the compiler
needs knowledge of the specific hardware to target. Which won't be available in
pre-compilation.

Maybe a project can define a number of profiles to represent different platforms
it supports, and the developer switches between them to view the different ways
their code could end up being parallelized. But that might be confusing and
maybe not that useful. But having the option to see how it looks on a specific
target (maybe to look into a specific bug) would certainly be useful.

Or maybe the compiler just splits the code into parallelizable packets, which
then get scheduled at runtime. That would be more flexible, but also carry some
overhead. And we'd be back to the developer not understanding the runtime
behavior of their application. Definitely lots of details to figure out before
this can happen, if it ever does.
