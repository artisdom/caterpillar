I have big ideas about what Caterpillar could be one day. I jokingly call that
my 20-year vision, although I'm not sure I have it in me, to work on this
project for the next 20 years. (But who knows.)

Rust has been my primary language for the last 9-10 years. Naturally that colors
my perception of what a language can be, and maybe should be. And Rust has some
very attractive properties: It can run almost anywhere; it provides low-level
access, but allows you to build safe abstraction on top; and it promotes robust
software by preventing a lot of mistakes.

But also, I realize that Rust already exists. I don't need to make another one.
And what Rust lacks, is immediate feedback. I want to build an interactive
programming language first, and then see how far I can take it. If the answer
ends up being, not quite far enough to be as universal, low-level, or robust as
Rust, then so be it. Immediate feedback comes first.
