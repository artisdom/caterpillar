Yesterday, I implied that supporting interactive programming in production
environments can be useful. Maybe to log into your server system to inspect a
weird edge case, instead of having to reproduce that locally. Or even a
customer's local system, working with them to reproduce an elusive bug.

Obviously this needs to be regulated somehow. You probably don't want to just
deploy a change directly to production, without any review or testing. And it
would be very rude (at the very least) to ship your application with a built-in
backdoor.

But I think there are ways to make this work. Permissions. Some kind of "sudo"
mode. Providing ways for the user to consent to remote access. Maybe even
teaching the runtime about staging and production environments, and integrate
with a CI/CD pipeline. I think there's a lot of potential here waiting to be
explored!
