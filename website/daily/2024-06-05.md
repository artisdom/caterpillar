I think one key element to making upgrades easy, is the ability to mix and match
different versions of the dependency you upgrade (which could be a library, the
language's standard library, or the language itself). Being able to mix and
match different versions of the language is interesting (and Rust editions kind
of allow that), but I'd like to talk about libraries today.

Rust does a pretty good job here too, as you can have multiple versions of the
same library in your dependency graph (as both transitive or direct
dependencies). But this is not without problems and can require
[elaborate workarounds][semver trick] to make work in practice.

[Unison] has a more fine-grained, and I think probably better, approach to this.
All code is content-addressed, which means even if types come from different
versions of a dependency (or even completely different libraries), they are
compatible as long as they are actually the same.
