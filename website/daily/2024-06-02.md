I'm wondering, should Caterpillar have releases at all? Well, yes, it should. At
least for the marketing and communication value that they provide. A big
announcement from time to time certainly has a different effect than a constant
stream of incremental changes.

But for the day-to-day, do we need them? Or should it just be that constant
stream, and you update your project however often you want? Then new changes
wouldn't have to sit around, but could go out to users pretty much immediately,
to benefit them and be tested by them.

That would, of course, require solid software engineering practices. A reliable
CI/CD pipeline, a comprehensive test suite, clear delineation between more
experimental and more stable features, and feature flags that users can opt
into.
