As of a few days ago, the debugger had a component called the "code explorer".
It's where you could see all your code, and set breakpoints anywhere. It wasn't
very good. Now it's gone, and if you want to set a breakpoint in code that's not
already in front of you, you just go into your editor and add a call to `brk`
there.

It also had an "execution context" which, if the program was currently stopped,
showed the current function where it was stopped. Next to that, there was a call
stack, which displayed the chain of functions that led to the current one. Both
of those are now gone, in favor of a single view of "active functions".

I have another idea, on how to simplify the way that the data function calls
operate on is displayed. That will further reduce the debugger's surface area,
and thus the maintenance burden going forward. I'm very happy about that. I have
the best chance at success, if I can pare what I already have down to its most
minimal form.
