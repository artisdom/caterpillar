I've been talking about logging "undo instructions" into a ring buffer, as
Caterpillar code gets executed, so you can always rewind your program to an
earlier state. But you have to limit the size of this buffer, and thus the
utility of this feature.

I think this can be solved though, by complementing this fine-grained
instruction-level approach with application-level events. Then we can take big
steps from event to event, and only use the more limited undo instruction buffer
to take closer looks in between.

This sounds like a job for Event Sourcing, but that's not an architecture you
can just implement in a language runtime. I needs to be supported on an
application or framework level. And I haven't fully figured out how that should
work.
