So what does it mean to have a code database? It means that the canonical
version of your code, what you store in your version control system, is not
plain text files, but a structured database. A plain text representation of the
code can still exist, as an input format for the developer, but what gets stored
is structured data that is already parsed and partially compiled.

Inference of types, effects, and other information, can happen during that
partial compilation step. Meaning the inferred information is stored in the code
database. If you modify the code, and that results in a change to an inferred
type, that change shows up in the diff of your commit.

There's also a performance benefit. The code database serves as a cache. Every
build becomes an incremental build; even the initial build after you clone a
repository. (Although that doesn't include any compilation steps that happen
afterwards, like code generation for the target platform. I don't know yet, how
that is going to fit into the bigger picture.)
