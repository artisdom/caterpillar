For the last few day's, I've been talking about the platform concept that I'm
stealing from Roc. I initially thought about platforms in terms of, CLI,
desktop, servers, browsers; places where you can run your applications, that
might look very different from each other. But I discovered that the platform
concept is widely applicable, and can be used in more subtle ways.

Earlier on, I talked about compile-time execution of Caterpillar code. This is a
very different environment, with different considerations. And it's not an easy
thing to do, if your language wasn't designed for it! Using Rust as an example
again, at some point it gained `const fn`. But that didn't just solve the
problem. What you can or can't do in a `const` context has been a perpetual
topic ever since, with every new release unlocking at least a few more standard
library functions.

But what if your language can do nothing by default, and gets all its
capabilities from an external platform? Then suddenly it's very easy. Because
the compiler is just another platform, which can provide you with I/O primitives
that are suitable for its context. Everything that can be powered by those I/O
primitives _just works_. And everything else can still be made to work, as long
as you manage to mock the required primitives.
