Caterpillar [is currently untyped](/daily/2024-07-16). This means that
everything is a 32-bit word, and depending on which function you call, the
arguments will get interpreted as whatever types the called function expects.
This isn't ideal, but it's simple and was easy to implement.

The end goal is a static type system, but I expected to have a dynamic type
system on the way there, as an intermediate step. I no longer think this is
going to happen. It seems more likely, that we'll transition from untyped to
static typing directly. As it turns out, "no type system" and "static type
system" are pretty similar.

In both cases, the runtime knows nothing about types. Whatever typing exists,
the compiler keeps track of. Right now, this means the compiler keeps track of
no types at all, but it's easy to imagine how that can change gradually. From
this perspective, a dynamic type system seems like a detour. It would require
significant changes to the runtime, which would then get reverted again later.
