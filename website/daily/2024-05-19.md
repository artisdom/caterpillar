Right now, I'm focused on addressing technical risks to Caterpillar's success.
But I think the only way to know that we really turned the corner, is for the
language to have actual users. People that prefer to work with Caterpillar, over
the other options available to them.

And since I have to start somewhere, I'm thinking I'll keep it simple and start
with myself. Make myself the first user of Caterpillar. That seems kinda
obvious. Of course I'm going to be the first to write code in the language I
create. But being a real user includes the "prefer it over other options" bit.

I want to get to a point where I genuinely want to work with Caterpillar,
independently of my desire to improve it. Just because I prefer the experience
of working with it over the experience of working with Rust (or whatever else).
If I can get to that point, that would be a strong sign that I'm on to
something.
