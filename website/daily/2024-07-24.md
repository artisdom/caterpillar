I just finished implementing `if` in Caterpillar. So far, I had very low-level
placeholders (`return_if_zero` and `return_if_non_zero`), which were easy to
implement, but obviously not what a high-level language needs.

Remember that Caterpillar still has no syntax. It is embedded into Rust, meaning
you can use a Rust API to build its syntax tree. The following is just
pseudocode to demonstrate how `if` in Caterpillar currently works, and what it
_could_ look like once syntax is implemented:

```
condition
{ do_if_true }
{ do_if_false }
    if
```

`if` is just a function call that takes three arguments: A condition (the
language is still untyped, so that's just a number; 0 is considered to be
"false"), a block of code for the "then" case, and another block of code for the
"else" case. I have my doubts about this, but for now I've decided to keep the
syntax simple and model as much as I can as function calls.
