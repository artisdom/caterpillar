I've talked about [inference](/daily/2024-07-21) before. How Caterpillar's
compiler could infer information about the code, and still make that explicit by
storing that in the [code database](/daily/2024-07-29), where it can be
displayed by tooling. I've thought about some more things that can benefit from
this approach.

My current plan (we'll see how far that goes) is for Caterpillar to not have
references, which would simplify the language greatly. If everything is
immutable, then a reference is semantically the same as a copy, and therefore
redundant. You'd still want them for performance though, and the compiler can
use them under the hood as an optimization technique.

Speaking of immutability, same deal here: You need mutation for performance, and
the compiler can make it happen under the hood. With a
[linear type system](/daily/2024-07-09), both of those techniques should be
practical. And with pre-compiled code as the canonical representation, the
developer can see where either is happening, and how changes to code affect
that.
