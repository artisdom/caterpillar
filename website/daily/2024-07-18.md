My work on Caterpillar has been a bit unfocused as of late. I started working on
re-adding interactive programming, then got tired of that for some reason, and
switched to working on better conditionals. While I did that, I was readily
distracted by opportunities to improve the architecture of compiler and
interpreter.

This isn't bad. These are all good and necessary things that need to get done.
But I also miss the experience of following a plan, getting things done,
crossing them off my list.

The most important thing is that I have fun. Because not only is that fun, it is
also the best guarantee of continued productivity. I think it would be ideal, if
I could find a way to do both: Make progress on a sensible, linear plan; but
also leave room for meandering. Working on whatever currently interests me.
