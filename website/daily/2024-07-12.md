Okay, so
[destructors are not a full alternative to linear types](/daily/2024-07-11), but
what about something like [Go]'s `defer` statement? That allows you to schedule
a function to be executed at the end of the current scope.

Again, this is a solution that works in many cases, but it's not a full
replacement for linear types. First off, you could forget to do it. Yes, it's
easier to remember, if you can put your `defer`red cleanup right next to where
you created the thing. But that's not a guarantee. Second, it only works for
resources you want to clean up in the current scope.

With linear types, the compiler forces you to use a value exactly once. And
returning it from the function is using it once. Then the caller can deal with
it, or return it again, or put it into a list to deal with later. Anything
really. You have full control about where you finally handle it, and yet can't
forget about it.
