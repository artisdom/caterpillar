I've mentioned linear types before, in the context of
[representing I/O resources as values](/daily/2024-07-06). In a linear type
system, values can be used _exactly_ once. This would be an error:

```
value do_thing
value do_other_thing # error! already used `value`
```

So far this is similar to Rust's type system, which uses _affine_ types. With
affine types, values can be used _at most_ once, meaning they can also be used
zero times. This is not possible with linear types:

```
make_value => value {
    # error! not using `value`
}
```

Being forced to use every value, means that errors need to be handled, files
need to be closed, etc. And this is enforced at compile-time, so you won't
forget.
