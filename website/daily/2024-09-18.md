[Infrastructure for rendering arbitrary types](/daily/2024-09-17) is just the
start. We also need the same kind of infrastructure for _editing_ arbitrary
types.

Yes, you can always type a new number in the editor. But for some values, it
might be better to have a slider. Imagine tweaking a value that way, and
experiencing the resulting change in your program right away. How much more
immediate of an experience would that be? How much more efficiently could you
tweak your code's behavior?

Other data types would require other kinds of special editors. And IDEs already
do that, sometimes. It's not uncommon to see a color picker when editing CSS,
for example. But as far as I've seen, it's always special-purpose. And I think
it needs to be a standard thing supported by the language and its tooling.
Something that every library author can use without hurdles.
