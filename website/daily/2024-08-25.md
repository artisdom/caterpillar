Tail call elimination
[leaves gaps in the call stack that will confuse the developer](/daily/2024-08-24),
when they're looking at an error in the debugger. For Caterpillar, with its
focus on interactivity, immediacy, and intuitiveness, this is an unacceptable
trade-off. Fortunately, there seems to be a solution: call stack reconstruction.

Let's start with the simple case (which is already implemented): `main` is the
entry point to every Caterpillar program, so if the call stack doesn't start
there, you know something's missing. (In the future that will probably depend on
the host, but for now it's true. Either way, the debugger only runs when a host
is present, so it can rely on host-specific knowledge.)

The fix is easy: Just add `main` to the start of the call stack. The debugger
also shows which expression within an active function called the next one, but
that's easy too: The stack frame was optimized away by tail call elimination, so
_it must have been a tail call_. We can mark the last expression in `main` as
the active one, and we're done.
