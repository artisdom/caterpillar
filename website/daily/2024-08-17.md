Let's revisit [pattern-matching functions](/daily/2024-08-13), as I've refined
how I think about them over the last few days.

First, nomenclature. The developer can define and call _functions_. A function
can be _named_ or _anonymous_. It has at least one, possibly multiple
_branches_. Each branch defines a list of _parameters_, in the form of
_patterns_. When the function is called, the first branch whose parameters match
the arguments, is selected and evaluated. The other branches are ignored.

Next, syntax. Let's assume that `{` and `}` are the syntax for defining
functions, and within that, `|a b c|` denotes the start of a new branch (in this
case, one with the parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`). While the semantics are
already implemented, Caterpillar still has no syntax. So this is all pseudo-code
that might end up looking completely different.

A simple named function with one branch:

```
plus_one: { |n| n 1 + }
```

An anonymous function would just be the part within `{ ... }`, and could be
defined wherever the parser accepts an expression.

A named function with multiple branches:

```
handle_input: {
    |0| # no input available; do nothing
    |1| move_up
    |2| move_left
    |3| move_down
    |4| move_right
    |n| "invalid input" panic
}
```

Here, the call `0 handle_input` would run a different branch than `1 input`, for
example.
