My long-term vision for Caterpillar is to make it statically typed, and provide
custom tooling that shows you precisely what your code is doing. Both should
help you notice and prevent all kinds of mistakes.

Over the last few days, I've been talking about how Caterpillar deals with
function arguments, and how the local operand stack works. These things are
somewhat limited in Caterpillar, compared to stack-based languages, to make them
less error-prone.

Maybe, once static typing and better tooling are available, those limitations
are no longer needed, and Caterpillar can become closer to a stack-based
language. We'll see; nothing is final. For now, the current design makes the
most sense, as best I can tell.
