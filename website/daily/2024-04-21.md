Event Sourcing is a software architecture in which every change to application
state is encoded as a value, an event. These events are executed
deterministically, so you can use them to reconstruct any past state. And if you
add the required information to these events, you can also undo them, rewinding
to an earlier state.

Over the last few days, I've been talking about how to step backwards through a
Caterpillar program. If Event Sourcing is to play a role in supporting this,
then the language runtime and debugger need to understand events. Where they are
stored, how to apply them to application state, how to undo them. All of this
implies a pretty close relationship between the Caterpillar runtime and an
application.

The runtime would act more like a framework than a typical language runtime,
which certainly wouldn't be a good fit for all use cases. But thanks to the
platform concept, it could be optional. Maybe I can come up with an approach
that allows applications to easily opt into event sourcing functionality when
they want to improve their interactivity, without weighing down applications
that don't need it.
