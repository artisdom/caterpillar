I've been talking about [call stack reconstruction](/daily/2024-08-25), starting
with a simple case. Let's move on to a slightly more complicated one.

Let's say you have the stack frame of function `a` on the call stack, its active
expression is a call to function `b`, but the next stack frame belongs to
function `c`. This is not right. We have detected a gap! At the very least, a
single stack frame (for `b`) is missing.

So before showing the active functions in the debugger, we add the missing `b`.
And we know that only tail call elimination removes stack frames, so the active
expression is the last one. From there we can repeat the check: is that last
expression a call to `c`? If not, there still is a gap, and we can keep adding
missing functions until it's closed.
