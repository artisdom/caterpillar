I sometimes have this tendency to overthink and overplan. Projects that should
have been quick experiments get delayed again and again, then wrapped up in a
grandiose strategy, before I finally get started. More than once, that grandiose
strategy then turned out to be a mistake. At that point, I was committed. The
project felt too important to just abandon.

I'm glad that I (maybe accidentally) chose the opposite strategy with
Caterpillar. It's been all about prototypes and learning from the start. And
I've never been shy to throw away any of those prototypes to just start fresh
with a new approach.

I'm doing a similar thing again, with this new format. Start small and, more
importantly, get started. Then learn, correct, or abandon. Whatever turns out to
be appropriate.
