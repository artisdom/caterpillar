[Implementing `if`](/daily/2024-07-24) was more difficult than I expected. Which
probably says more about my estimation abilities than the difficulty of
implementing `if`. But either way, it required more sophistication from the
compiler than it had before.

Previously, the code was pretty flat and linear. Now, with blocks of code being
passed to `if`, there's a lexical hierarchy to it. This required some changes to
the intermediate representation. I knew from a previous prototype that
content-addressed code fragments would do the job (and are necessary for
interactive programming anyway), so I just implemented that.

Those blocks of code also needed to be able to refer to bindings from their
parent scope, so I implemented lexical scoping and made those blocks full
closures. This was probably a bit more than was necessary right now, but I ran
with it. We'll need closures anyway, sooner or later, and now we have them.
