When I talked about the concept of "solid" and "fluid" code yesterday, I glossed
over one thing. I said you could change the boundary between solid and fluid
code on the fly, but that would still require machinery that you can connect to
and deploy new versions with. Would that still be zero-overhead?

Maybe not, but I don't think it matters. If you're deploying to a server, you
would have some means to upgrade your application in any case. If you're
deploying to microcontrollers, you might have a bootloader that you can use to
upgrade your firmware over the network. In these situations, you have that
overhead anyway. It just moves from SSH, or whatever you're using, into the
language runtime.

That still leaves some other cases, like function-as-a-service platforms, or
deeply embedded systems that don't allow upgrading the firmware. If you're
running something like that, and you can't afford the additional overhead, there
could still be a "all-solid/no-updates" fallback mode. This would basically be
the same as deploying any other compiled, non-interactive language.
