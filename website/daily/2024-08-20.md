The other day, I presented
[how common conditional constructs can map to pattern-matching functions](/daily/2024-08-18).
But there's more to control flow! Today, let's look at iteration, starting with
a simple `loop` in Rust:

```rust
loop {
    do_this_forever();
}
```

In Caterpillar, this could look like this:

```
{
    || do_this_forever recur
}
    eval
```

Here we define an anonymous function that just calls itself forever. (`recur`
doesn't exist in the language right now. It would call the current function
recursively, without having to name it. This is not possible yet for anonymous
functions, but named ones could just call themselves by name instead.)

A slightly more complex loop:

```rust
let mut i = 0;
while i < 10 {
    do_the_thing();
    i += 1;
}
```

And the Caterpillar version:

```
0
{
    |10|
        # we're done

    |n|
        do_the_thing
        n 1 + recur
}
    eval
```

As with conditionals, I expect that Caterpillar will have more convenient
constructs built on top of this, as syntax sugar. (And with Caterpillar being a
functional language, I expect those to be of the `map`, `filter`, and `fold`
variety, rather than the more imperative loops I've shown here. But the point
was to demonstrate how simple loops can map to pattern-matching functions.)
