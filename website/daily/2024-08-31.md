Call stack hints [are straight-forward enough](/daily/2024-08-30), if you just
look at simple cases. But I'm not so sure how they would work in the presence of
mutual recursion. In that case, it might be necessary to search more deeply into
the stack to find a hint, causing more runtime overhead.

I honestly don't know, if that's going to be a problem, or if there are clever
ways to keep the overhead minimal. I need more time to think about this. And
once I start implementing call stack hints, I'll probably come up with new
insights too.

One last case we haven't looked at yet are anonymous functions. Those can also
have branches, which might necessitate call stack hints. I can't think of a
reason why that case would be different from named functions though. So I think
this won't require any special handling.
