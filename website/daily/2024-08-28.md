The approaches to call stack reconstruction I've presented so far
([[1]](/daily/2024-08-25), [[2]](/daily/2024-08-27)) do not cover all possible
cases. One limitation that I do know of, is if a missing function is called by
another function which has multiple branches. I'd like to talk about that
tomorrow.

Aside from that, I can't shake the feeling that the
[algorithm I explained yesterday](/daily/2024-08-27) must have other limitations
that I'm missing. But I can't come up with an example (aside from the
aforementioned multi-branch case) that _won't_ work.

If you can spot any problems that I've been missing, then I'd
[love to hear about it](mailto:hello@hannobraun.com)!
