Semantic versioning is a widespread practice, to manage breaking changes and
communicate which releases contain them. Version 2.0 contains breaking changes.
Version 2.1 doesn't, nor does any other 2.x release. You don't have to worry
again until 3.0.

In my experience, this can work pretty. But for a large project, it seems to be
limiting. There could be new features, that are experimental and still subject
to change. Older ones, that are stable and mature. Even older ones that you want
to change again, because you now understand all their flaws.

I think that trying to address this all with a single semantic version number
might be too coarse-grained. Rust, for example, seems to acknowledge this, by
using using additional mechanisms (a nightly channel with unstable features, and
the limited but effective edition mechanism). I wonder, if there's a simpler way
for Caterpillar.
