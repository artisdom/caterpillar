I believe that [pattern-matching functions](/daily/2024-08-17) are a powerful
primitive that can
[serve as the foundation for all control flow](/daily/2024-08-16). Let's see how
we can implement common control flow constructs based on them.

In addition to [the syntax I proposed yesterday](/daily/2024-08-17), I'm using
`eval` here, which evaluates an anonymous function. Let's start with a simple
`if` expression in Rust:

```rust
if condition {
    handle_then();
} else {
    handle_else();
}
```

In the (still, but not for much longer) fictional pseudo-Caterpillar syntax,
this could map to this:

```
condition
{
    |true| handle_then
    |false| handle_else
}
    eval
```

Of course, we'll likely have an `if` expression in Caterpillar too. But under
the hood, this is what it would translate to. An anonymous function with two
branches, one matching on `true`, the other on `false`. (Which are also not in
the language yet; right now we just have numbers.)

Next example, `match` expression in Rust:

```rust
match n {
    0 => handle_zero(),
    1 => handle_one(),
    n => handle_any(n),
}
```

That would be a straight-forward translation into a pattern-matching function in
pseudo-syntax Caterpillar:

```
n
{
    |0| handle_zero
    |1| handle_one
    |n| n handle_any
}
    eval
```

Or you could write it as a named function:

```
n handle_number

# Defined somewhere else:
handle_number: {
    |0| handle_zero
    |1| handle_one
    |n| n handle_any
}
```

And again, Caterpillar could have a dedicated `match` expression too, to make
this syntactically more convenient. But under the hood, if would all be
pattern-matching functions.
