So yeah, I've got [some emotional stuff](/daily/2024-10-25) to unpack before I
can make a decision on
[changing my primary development focus](/daily/2024-10-22). But in the meantime,
I've come up with two objective reasons why a
[switch to microcontroller firmware](/daily/2024-10-24) would be detrimental.

First, it would delay anything else that needs to get done. Probably not too
badly. A few weeks, maybe, most of that to teach the tooling how to deal with a
microcontroller. But still, on the game development side, I have a perfectly
fine (if basic) testbed for additional improvements to the language and tooling,
right now. And those are among my top priorities.

Second, and maybe more importantly, it would be inherently less demo-able. Once
things are ready for that, I want a live demo to be front and center on the
website. I can't expect every visitor to have a dev board at the ready. Nor will
I always have one with me, when I want to quickly show someone the project.
Games can run on websites and on my phone. Firmware can't.
