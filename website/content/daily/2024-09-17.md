I believe that
[languages should provide infrastructure to render data types as more than just text](/daily/2024-09-16).
But I don't think it's enough to just build vectors into the language and
hardcode how to render them into the tooling. This might work for vectors, but
the concept is applicable to so much more. It needs to be extensible by the
developer.

Understanding a geometric algorithm using vectors, is going to require a much
different graphical representation than understanding a sorting algorithm. And
maybe a much different representation than a different geometric algorithm also
using vectors. I think trying to solve that at the language level would be of
limited benefit.

I believe the visualizations need to be defined at the library level. The
language just needs to provide common infrastructure that libraries can build
on, and that the tooling can understand, without having to know the specifics of
the library.
