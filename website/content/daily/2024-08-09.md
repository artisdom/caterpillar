I talked about [tail call elimination](/daily/2024-08-08) yesterday, but let's
expand on that a bit, to make sure we're on the same page.

Whenever Caterpillar code calls a function, then (in principle) a new stack
frame is added to the stack. That stack frame contains the local variables of
that function, but also a return address. A function can be called from multiple
places, so the compiler can't know where to go once it ends. That's why we need
to keep track of a return address at runtime.

And that's where we catch up to yesterday: If a call is last in a function (a
"tail call"), then we don't need to return there. If we did, we would
immediately return again. That's useless work and wasted stack space. So what we
do instead, is to reuse the stack frame of the calling function. Save one stack
frame and one return. That is tail call elimination.
