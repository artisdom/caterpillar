On the topic of memory allocation, there's an interesting perspective I came
across recently: That memory allocation should be async. Meaning that the memory
allocation API should not necessarily return an error, if enough memory isn't
available right now; but a future or promise that resolves to allocated memory,
once that _becomes_ available.

[James Munns] presented this
[on the Self-Directed Research Podcast](https://sdr-podcast.com/episodes/async-allocators/).
That idea makes a lot of sense to me. And while nothing is set in stone
regarding concurrency in Caterpillar, the same async/await style that Rust uses
seems like a good fit. Maybe this approach to memory allocation will be a good
fit too!
