There are more reasons to have [a custom editor](/daily/2024-09-14) than to
serve as a daily driver for development. It can also be useful as a
special-purpose tool.

For example, I might want to run one in the browser, right on the Caterpillar
home page, to provide an interactive demo. And if it's lightweight enough, then
why not run 20 instances on the same page, as part of an interactive tutorial?

Another use case for a lightweight custom editor might be a mobile application.
I don't think I'd ever want to use my phone as a serious development platform.
But what about briefly sketching out an idea? Or giving a quick demo to someone
I've just met? I can definitely see the advantages in having something like that
available on the go.
