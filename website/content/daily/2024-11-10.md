So yeah, type inference in the presence of recursive function calls
[is complicated](/daily/2024-11-09). If you're calling yourself, then during
type inference, you encounter the call to yourself before you've figured out
your own type. Hence you can't figure out the type of the call, which prevents
you from figuring out your own type.

The key insight to resolving this contradiction, is that a function consists of
multiple branches. If _all_ branches end up calling the function itself, then
the function never returns (it _diverges_). I wrote a compiler pass that detects
this relatively easily, using a call graph. We'll see how that holds up, once
I've been using it under real conditions for a bit.

If _some_ branches diverge while others don't, then it's possible to infer the
signature of a function based on its non-diverging branches. The tricky thing
is, that you need to infer those branches _in the right order_. So far, I've
failed with a more dynamic solution to this, based on a queue. Too easy to run
into endless loops. Now I'm looking into another approach based on a call graph.
