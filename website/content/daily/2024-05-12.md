The current Caterpillar prototype is focused around the question, if a debugger
is a practical solution for getting the language to a useful state relatively
quickly. A debugger needs breakpoints, and right now those are implemented by
always checking between instructions, if there's a breakpoint at the current
one.

Which is fine, for now. But it seems like the kind of thing that the language
won't be able to afford in the long-term, for performance reasons. So today, I
had this idea: If the language is interactive anyway, meaning I can deploy code
into the running program, then why don't I just deploy new code that implements
the breakpoint?

Then breakpoints would only cause overhead right where you need them. Which
would still leave the overhead of the interactive runtime, of course, but since
that is the central premise of the language, I'll have to make that work
_somehow_.
