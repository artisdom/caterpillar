I'm sure there are many approaches for implementing
[expression-level rewinding](/daily/2024-11-18), but the ones I could think of
all boil down to a single principle: While you evaluate expressions, you log the
information you need to undo those expressions later. Who does that logging, and
what specifically is being logged, that's where the differences are.

As for who does the logging (or more precisely, who's responsible for making
sure it happens), there are two candidates: the runtime and the compiler. I
think having the compiler do it is more attractive overall, because that makes
it easy to disable, leaving no runtime overhead; and because it's still going to
work once Caterpillar is compiled to machine code (or WebAssembly).

But having the runtime do it might be the more practical option in the short
term. As far as I can tell, that could be a relatively simple and robust
solution, while having the compiler orchestrate it would be more complex, with
more moving parts. Over the next few days, I'll be looking into this a bit more
deeply.
