I think it's time to post a quick update about what I'm currently working on.
First, what I _should_ be working on, is implementing a way to deploy
Caterpillar games to a website. That has been at the top of my list for a while.
Right now, you only can run your game through a local development server that's
included in the Caterpillar repository.

What I'm working on _instead_ is a static type system. When I started to
consider [an immediate switch of focus](/daily/2024-10-22), I figured it might
be nice to make sure the Caterpillar runtime can run on bare-metal targets. I've
long wanted this, both for future-proofing, but also because it's connected to
some simplifications I would like to make.

Getting that done was basically just a formality, as the runtime is pretty much
isolated from anything else already. But it still allocates dynamic memory,
which I also want to avoid. And even though
[I'm not going to switch focus](/daily/2024-11-01) for the time being, I'd still
like to simplify the runtime. Which means the compiler needs to become smarter.
