As I'm talking about
[separately optimizing input code and rendered code](/daily/2025-01-05) for
their respective purposes, I realize that what I'm describing is basically
[WYSIWYG]. Except that there is no printed form that would unambiguously define
"what you get". Instead, deciding what the "what you see" part should be, is a
big part of the design challenge.

I'm not sure what to make of this realization. Ironically, I've always preferred
plain text formats over WYSIWYG. WYSIWYG editors always seem to have hidden
state that I don't understand, and can easily mess up. While plain text formats
might be a bit more clunky, but easier to understand.

Maybe that's just a matter of implementation quality, and it's possible to do
better. I don't know. But either way, how different the rendered code is from
traditional programming language representations, and how different input code
is from rendered code, those are spectrums. I could always decide to land on the
conservative end of those, instead of making something novel and ambitious.
