I've mentioned before that
[Caterpillar could become less restrictive around how functions are defined](/daily/2024-06-25),
as it grows more features that help to notice and prevent mistakes. Then,
function arguments could become implicit, which could look like this:

```
fn increment { 1 + }
```

We know that `+` takes two arguments, and since we only provide one argument, we
know that the function needs to take another one. But maybe we want to make that
explicit, in some cases. If we combine the previous syntax with
[my idea for assignment expressions](/daily/2024-06-28), that could look like
this:

```
fn increment { => x
    { x 1 + }
}
```

On a conceptual level, I find this elegant. There is no special syntax for
optional function arguments. Every function declaration would just be
`fn <name> <body>`, and you can combine that with an orthogonal feature, binding
expressions, to specify arguments where that is desirable.

But the syntax is kind of ugly, with the double parentheses. Maybe I can come up
with something better.
