I've been talking about postfix operators for days now. If you've already been
familiar with them before, then you might be surprised that I haven't mentioned
the stack once. I did that to keep my explanations simple, but also to make a
point. We can develop an intuition for this, without constantly thinking about
the stack.

For those not familiar, the evaluation model behind postfix operators is a
stack. Let's consider a simple math example again, `1 2 +`. We can say that `1`
is a function which puts `1` on the stack. The stack contains `1` afterwards.
After `2`, the stack contains `1 2`. `+` is a function that takes two numbers
from the stack, and puts their sum back (the stack contains `3` afterwards).

The stack _is_ important. It's how this model is implemented behind the scenes,
and it's a method for understanding how it works. But my point is, we don't need
to constantly think (and talk!) about the stack. Just like we don't constantly
think and talk about graphs, when working with operations involving infix
operators.
