I've been envisioning (and previous Caterpillar prototypes have already done
this) using `[` and `]` for list literals:

```
[ a b ] # `a` and `b` have the same type
```

I think that's a pretty common thing to do.

Following [Rust]'s syntax, I'd like to use `(` and `)` for tuples:

```
( a b ) # `a` and `b` can have different types
```

And since I'm [considering a syntax change](/daily/2024-10-05) that would free
up `{` and `}`, those could be used for map and struct/record literals:

```
{
    x: 5
    y: 10
}
```

There are more details to figure out, but those are the broad strokes of what
could go into the language.
