Given the
[disadvantages of delimiter-less data structure literals](/daily/2024-10-07),
it's probably better to just use commas everywhere. `[ a b ]` would become
`[ a, b ]`; `[ a b 1 + ]` would become `[ a, b 1 + ]`. It's a small sacrifice in
the name of readability and simplicity.

If that's the solution, branch parameters should be updated too. They don't need
delimiters to be unambiguous _or_ readable, but I think this is a case where
consistency aids learnability.

In addition, they're likely to get more complex, as more sophisticated pattern
matching is introduced. Maybe having delimiters there will become advantageous
or even necessary in itself.
