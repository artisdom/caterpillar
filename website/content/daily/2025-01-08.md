From the start, I've been organizing my work on Crosscut as a series of
prototypes. Whenever I felt that a path I had taken wasn't great, and that
another approach would be more promising, I wasn't shy about
[archiving][archive] what I had to start fresh. Because Crosscut was never about
a specific implementation. It's about a vision of what programming can be.

The project has benefited greatly from this approach. It's almost absurd to
imagine where things would have gone, based on my initial set of ideas. Most
likely, it would have gone nowhere, and I would no longer be working on it.

And now I started working on a new prototype! As I've come to realize, the
previous one has quite a few problems, that I might be able to avoid using a
different approach. But I'm not fully committed yet. For now, the new prototype
lives in a separate directory, and I haven't archived the previous one. I want
to see first, if the new prototype works out.
