I'm currently working code update implementation, with the goal of making code
updates more reliable. I _thought_ I had this pretty much figured out in an
[earlier prototype] (with some adaptations required, because that prototype ran
everything in a single process). Turns out, this isn't really the case. I must
have had a bit of tunnel vision.

That old implementation is much more limited than I thought it was, and there's
still lots to figure out to make it practical. So I'm back to the drawing board.
I'm getting there. But working on this again, and having talked about the
[code database](/daily/2024-07-29) and a [custom editor](/daily/2024-09-14)
lately, doing this based on text files strikes me as deeply suboptimal.

To perform a successful code update, the compiler needs to figure out exactly
what changed, so it can generate code to transition from the old version to the
new. And the editor already had that information, but then threw it away. This
would be much easier, if we didn't have to reconstruct those changes by
comparing their end results.
