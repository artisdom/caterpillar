I can think of [two approaches](/daily/2024-12-31) for editing a structured code
database. I'm not sure which one is better. From an idealistic perspective, a
custom editor seems superior, but it would also be a lot of work to get right.
Work that could be spent elsewhere. The "checkout" approach allows for re-using
existing infrastructure, but doesn't come for free either.

I'm not at all sure where I'll land on that. Maybe start with the checkout
approach as a stopgap, with the long-term goal of having a custom editor. But
who knows. Either way, today I'd like to start thinking through how having a
custom editor affects what syntax is.

With the checkout approach, I think the role of syntax doesn't really change.
You still have a plain-text representation of the code, used both for displaying
and editing. That's no longer the _source_ code, but I don't think that changes
anything fundamentally when it comes to syntax. A custom editor, on the other
hand, does change things fundamentally. I'd like to dive into that tomorrow.
