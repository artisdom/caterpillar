Over the last few days, we've looked at several of the ad-hoc effects in Rust.
First [`Result` and panics](/daily/2024-12-13), then
[asynchrony](/daily/2024-12-14). Armed with that knowledge, we can now imagine a
unified system that includes the most powerful aspects of all of them, and can
support any kind of effect.

Here's what such a unified system could include:

- It would use a side channel to transport effects, instead of return values.
  The caller doesn't have to know about the effect, and a handler can sit
  anywhere in the call chain.
- Handlers themselves can trigger the effect (or any other), allowing for nested
  handlers that can make a decision at their respective level.
- Any code that triggers an effect can be resumed afterwards, if the handler
  decides it's appropriate.

A language that has such a system, could use it to provide all kinds of effects.
The ones I already mentioned, but also I/O could be covered by effects.
Randomness could be, making it easy to control where that's important (think
multiplayer games). In Rust, `unsafe` could be one! Imagine using that to easily
sandbox any dependency you don't trust.
