So yeah, [lots to consider](/daily/2024-12-04) about rewinding I/O effects.
What's clear, is that different effects have to be treated differently, and that
the host has to provide that information. So this is going to be one of the
things that has to be part of the interface that the compiler and/or runtime can
use to query the host.

Things get even more complicated, if the developer rewinds over an effect, makes
changes, then moves forward again, re-running the modified effect. Again, there
are easy cases. If the effect is a sound, just play the modified sound. But if
it's a network request, the server might or might not handle a second, different
network request well.

If the host doesn't know (because it allows generic network requests and has no
understanding of the protocol), then I guess a general fallback would be to ask
the developer what to do. Or refuse to do anything without restarting the
program. So rewinding won't always be a completely smooth experience. But I hope
it can be smooth enough to make it a big win overall.
