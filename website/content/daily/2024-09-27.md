My insight, that code updates would be
[better served by a different approach](/daily/2024-09-26), but that this
different approach is not practical to implement right now, leaves me in a bit
of a bind. On the one hand, I need a provisional solution that actually works.
But on the other, I don't want to put _too much_ effort into something
temporary.

The answer I've come up with, is to reduce the scope of my provisional solution
as much as possible, implement that, then only widen the scope if the result is
untenable. I hope that I won't have to go through more than a few iterations of
this, so not too much work is wasted in the long run.

This requires an iterative approach to the problem, of course, and I have an
idea for how to make this happen. But that's a topic for tomorrow.
