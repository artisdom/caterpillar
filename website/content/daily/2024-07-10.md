Even if you have a [linear type system](/daily/2024-07-09), that doesn't mean
_every_ type needs to be linear. It's totally fine to also have types whose
values can be copied implicitly (i.e. used multiple times), or dropped
implicitly (i.e. used zero times).

Something like this is implemented in [Rust], which has affine types by default
(used _at most_ once; i.e. they are _moved_, not _copied_). But you can derive
`Copy` for a type, meaning values of that type get copied implicitly. That
allows you to use them more than once, which makes the type no longer affine.

In a similar vein, types in Caterpillar could be linear by default, but then be
marked as `AutoCopy` (for types you might want to use more than once) or
`AutoDrop` (for types you might want to use zero times). And this is a totally
reasonable thing to do, for example for pure values like numbers or vectors.
