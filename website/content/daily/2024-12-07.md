[Effects](/daily/2024-12-06) in Caterpillar happen under the hood. They are
implemented in the runtime, and the compiler knows about them, but they are not
a part of the language. They are an implementation detail. But that could
change.

At a minimum, it would be possible to annotate functions with the effects they
could have. So if a function calls a host function that triggers a "write file"
effect, for example, then the function could be annotated as having that effect.
And any function that calls it (and any function that calls _that_ function,
recursively), would be annotated with that effect too.

Then you could look at a part of your program (or your `main` function, if you
want to look at your program as a whole) and see what kinds of I/O it could
potentially do, and what kinds of errors it could potentially trigger. But by
itself, this is of dubious value, as I intend to explain tomorrow.
