Okay, so
[the code update algorithm will determine how code got updated](/daily/2024-09-28).
But what can the compiler do with that information?

Here's my idea: If code inside a function has updates, the new version of the
function is compiled, and the resulting instructions are appended at the end of
the already existing code. This means in this first step, we only add new code,
and the old code stays the same. That alone isn't enough, however, because how
would that new code ever get executed?

And that's where the output from the update algorithm comes in.
[We know](/daily/2024-09-28) that `x` replaced `b`. We already compiled the new
function containing `x`. To make sure that new function then gets executed, we
replace all calls to the old function with calls to the new function. But we
also replace `b` with a jump to `x`. So if we were about to execute `b`, we'll
execute `x` instead.
