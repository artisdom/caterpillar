Last week, I wrote about that ugly debugger I wrote for the current Caterpillar
prototype. I still needed to make some improvements to the debugger and the
language runtime, but I was finally able to debug that broken code I had sitting
in a local branch.

The debugger is still ugly as hell, but it's starting to shed some light on the
core questions that the current prototype was created to answer: Yes, it seems
practical to build a debugger for Caterpillar. Yes, this debugger makes it
practical to work with a language that is otherwise very confusing.

My next goal is to further substantiate these answers, by writing more code.
What I currently have just draws a white background into a window. I want to
turn this into a small [snake] game.
