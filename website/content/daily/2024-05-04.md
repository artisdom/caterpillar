Yesterday, I said that I only want to provide postfix operator in Caterpillar.
I'd like to explain why I like them, starting with simple math operations. If we
want to add two numbers, we'd typically write this with an infix operator:
`1 + 2`. In postfix, this would be `1 2 +`.

This might look unfamiliar, but it's extremely simple to work with: Just start
at the left. There's one value (`1`), then there's another (`2`), and then we
add those (`+`). If we want to multiply the result by `3`, we can write this as
`1 2 + 3 *` (infix: `(1 + 2) * 3`). Multiplying first is easy too: `2 3 * 1 +`
(infix: `1 + 2 * 3`).

This exposes a neat thing about postfix operators: You never need parentheses,
nor is there any operator precedence. It always goes left to right. `1` and `2`
added is `3`. `3` and `3` multiplied is `9`. Or in the second example, `2` and
`3` multiplied is `6`. `6` and `1` added is `7`.
