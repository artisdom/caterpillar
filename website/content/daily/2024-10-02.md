Okay, let's step back for a moment. I
[wanted to talk about the code update algorithm](/daily/2024-09-28), but first I
needed to lay some foundations. For that reason, I've been giving some context
on the code update algorithm: the output it produces and how I intend to use
that.

I [also said](/daily/2024-09-28) that I was going to explain some details about
the representation of code in the compiler next. But I think this is no longer
necessary! Because during my explanations over the last few days,
[I realized that I can get away with a simpler approach](/daily/2024-09-30).

Which is a nice side effect of writing daily. I helps me think, and by
extension, come up with better solutions. So I guess tomorrow, I'll collect my
thoughts and present a revised plan for the code update algorithm!
