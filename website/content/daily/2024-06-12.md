I mentioned yesterday, that Caterpillar is edited outside of the browser, on my
native system. Changes to the running program will have to be sent into the
browser, via a development server. This isn't the only way I could do it, and
I'd like to talk about that today.

Long-term, I expect things to work differently. Instead of editing plain text
files, I want to store source code in a structured code database (similar to
[Unison]). Users would edit that code database directly, via custom tooling,
including a custom editor. All of that _could_ run in the browser, but the
database could function as a distributed version control system, exchanging code
with nodes running elsewhere.

That approach has too many benefits to ignore, but it's also going to take a lot
of work to get there. And in the meantime, I want Caterpillar to function. Which
means integrating with traditional tooling, like editors and version control
systems. These run on traditional operating systems and expect code to be stored
in plain text files. So that's how Caterpillar is going to work too, for the
time being.
