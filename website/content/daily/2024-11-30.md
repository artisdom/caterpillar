I've been talking about rewinding expressions using a
[runtime-based implementation](/daily/2024-11-20). But what about a
compiler-based approach? The information required to rewind already executed
code is only available at runtime. So the work itself is definitely happening
then. But the compiler can be responsible for _orchestrating_ that work.

At its core, this would look similar to a runtime-orchestrated approach: There'd
be some kind of buffer with information on how to undo an instruction, and that
buffer would get filled, as regular (non-rewind) code gets executed.

So basically, the compiler would generate all of the following:

- Regular instructions, that do the things that need to get done.
- Interspersed with those, instructions that generate "undo data".
- Undo instructions, that use that undo data to undo the regular instructions.

Starting tomorrow, I'm going to take a closer look at this.
