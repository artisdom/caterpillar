I'm a big believer in automated testing, but there's a time and a place. Many
projects require a phase of exploration, as you figure out the shape of the
thing you're building. Tests only get in the way then (at least in my
experience). The current iteration of Caterpillar has been in such an
exploration phase, and so I didn't write any tests.

Which was fine, but I think I missed the transition point from exploration to
engineering. My recent work on the core language has broken many features in the
periphery. The snake game only partially works now, crashing the moment I press
a button. And I can't fix that, because the debugger has deteriorated too, to
the point of being unusable.

Time to roll up my sleeves, fix some bugs, and make sure that each feature I'm
fixing gets covered by a test. I'm working hard on making Caterpillar usable for
real projects, and while it will be a long time before the language is truly
mature, there is only so much breakage I am willing to tolerate.
