I've been working on the debugger recently, which by extension triggered lots of
cleanup all over the codebase.

Support for debugging features has mostly moved out of the runtime. The debugger
can send new code there any time (which can include instructions that trigger
breakpoints). It turns out, that can get you pretty far in implementing all
kinds of debugging stuff, in combination with a few select commands that the
runtime responds to.

I've implemented "Step Over" and "Step Out", alongside the previously available
"Step In". It works well in basic cases, but overall, it's still pretty buggy. I
need to map out what specifically is broken, so I can write tests for that and
fix it.
