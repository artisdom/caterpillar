We could [annotate functions](/daily/2024-12-07) with the effects they can
trigger. I think this is of limited use, for two reasons: It would be redundant,
and it would be noisy. Let's start with the redundancy.

I want to represent the effects that a function can have in its parameters and
return values. So a function that could write to a file, should
[take a value](/daily/2024-07-06) that represents that file as an argument, and
return a value that represents the modified file. (Which requires
[linear types](/daily/2024-07-09)).

Annotating a function with a "write file" effect isn't necessary, if it already
takes and returns a `File`. Although, I guess, the effect would provide further
clarification, if multiple things can be done to that file. Or maybe having the
effect makes taking the linear `File` value redundant? I'm not sure. There'll be
lots of design space to explore, once we get to that.
