The host in Caterpillar [embeds the runtime](/daily/2024-11-12), providing
platform-specific capabilities. Right now, the runtime is a bytecode
interpreter. The host is an application that runs this interpreter. The host I'm
currently working on (the game engine) is specifically a web application, but
other hosts could be running on Linux/Windows/macOS, microcontrollers, whatever.

But the host does not _only_ exist at runtime. It's also a compile-time concept.
The compiler is not tied to a specific host, but it can query the current one
over a generic interface. Using that interface, it can determine whether a given
identifier in the code refers to a host function, and generate code accordingly.

This is just the current state. At some point, I want to compile Caterpillar to
WebAssembly and native machine code. Then the host could turn into a concept
that _only_ exists at compile-time. You don't really need a runtime component
that executes a host function, if you can instead teach the compiler to generate
code that does the same thing.
