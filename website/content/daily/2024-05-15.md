If you had the greatest team of all time, and you set them to work on the wrong
things, then their output would be worthless to you. And very likely, that would
not be obvious for a good while. Going fast into the wrong direction can feel
very productive.

And I don't have the greatest, or any, team. It's just myself, for the time
being. So it's critical that I don't waste my efforts. That I spend my limited
resources where it counts.

That's why I always try to think about what is important to work on right now.
Questioning whether what I'm doing is actually advancing Caterpillar in a
direction that matters. I'm honestly not sure how well I'm doing that. But I
guess time will tell, one way or the other.
