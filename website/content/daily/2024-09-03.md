I've talked about
[the relative importance of developer experience and performance](/daily/2024-09-01).
It's worth noting though, that both aren't always in conflict.

For example, static typing (at least as implemented in many modern languages) is
arguably good for developer experience. And it's also a win for performance.
Both are reasons that I want to have it in Caterpillar.
