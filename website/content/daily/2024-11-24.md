So what about the efficiency of
[using micro-instructions as undo instructions](/daily/2024-11-23)? Let's get
back to [our example](/daily/2024-11-20), the expression `1 2 +` which
translates to the instructions `push 1`, `push 2`, `add`. We can undo the `add`
with `pop`, `push 1`, `push 2`, the `push 2` with a `pop`, and the `push 1` with
another `pop`.

So `pop`, `push 1`, `push 2`, `pop`, `pop`. Five micro-instructions to undo
three regular ones; pretty much [the same as before](/daily/2024-11-21). This
does not seem any more efficient. But remember, there are far fewer
micro-instructions than regular instructions. So their encoding can be more
compact. Those five wouldn't take up a lot of bytes.

Is this the best approach? I don't know. But it seems like the best bet for an
initial attempt, for the implementation simplicity alone.
