The decision I'm currently considering, to
[switch to microcontroller firmware](/daily/2024-10-24) as the primary use case
for Caterpillar, it's not a done deal. It does seem to make a lot of sense, but
there's a part of me that isn't convinced yet. And that's fine. I like to sit
with these kinds of decisions for a while, to make sure I'm not making an
impulsive one.

Even though [I rarely play games these days](/daily/2024-10-22), and consider
many of them a harmful waste of time, there's something that still grabs me
about that world. Because games definitely have artistic merit. And there are
those that have really resonated with me. That I have gotten more out of than I
put in, in a sense.

I started doing game development in my teens and had ambitions, lasting into my
early thirties, to make that my career. That ended in failure. Almost everything
I worked on was too big to ever get finished. Maybe there's a part of me that
doesn't want to let go of the past. That wants a chance to do it right this
time.
