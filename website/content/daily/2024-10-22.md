Caterpillar is not a hobby to me. I take it very seriously. It is currently the
project that I spend the most time on, and I'd like to keep it that way. That
means I have to find ways to earn money with it. Otherwise, I'll always be
distracted by other things, in order to fund it.

If I want to earn money, I need to provide value. Which means the project needs
users. Happy and successful users! And to achieve that as quickly as I can, I've
been focusing on a single use case. So far, that has been simple browser games.
I even planned to market it specifically as a tool for game jams, as that seemed
to be a good fit for a new language.

But now I consider changing this plan. It makes a lot of sense in terms of
technical roadmap, I think. But targeting a largely hobbyist market was always a
bit dubious in terms of commercial viability. Maybe more importantly, this plan
doesn't really fit with me, personally. I'm fascinated by games, and the idea of
developing them. But I rarely even play them anymore.
