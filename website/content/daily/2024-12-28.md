Aside from the [work on type inference](/daily/2024-12-27), I've been making
changes to the syntax again.

Comments are much better supported now. They were already fully supported in
branch bodies. In addition, the parser has been accepting them in front of named
functions for a while, but those were just thrown away and not rendered in the
debugger. Now they are stored in the syntax tree, as are comments on branches.
Although both are still not rendered in the debugger yet ([#65], [#66]).

Comments on named functions and branches are actually associated with that named
function or branch in the syntax tree (as opposed to being stored as an
independent element). Making that work, while still keeping the language grammar
[LL(1)], required changes, which then triggered further changes, to make things
more consistent. I'll talk about that tomorrow.
