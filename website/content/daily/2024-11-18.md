Quite a while ago, I talked about
[rewinding your running program](/daily/2024-04-18). More recently, I expanded
on that, by looking at coarse-grained,
[event-based rewinding](/daily/2024-11-04) again. Today, I'd like to take
revisit fine-grained, expression-based rewinding.

First, let's talk about the difference in nomenclature, because I was calling
this "instruction-based" rewinding before. Back then, it didn't make much of a
difference, since expressions in the compiler and instructions in the runtime
were pretty much the same thing. But as the compiler is getting smarter, and the
runtime is getting simpler, those concepts have started to diverge.

Expressions are what the developer is concerned with and (hopefully)
understands, while instructions are an implementation detail. So it makes more
sense to base fine-grained rewinding on expressions rather than instructions.
Next, I'd like to talk about how to implement that.
