Right now, Caterpillar just has a single global context. But in the future, all
functions will be defined in modules. I haven't fully worked out the design yet,
but what if a module is just a function that is executed at compile-time,
returning the items it wants to export? Then any argument to that module
function would be available at compile-time.

If that were the case, here's how that
[Zig example I showed yesterday](/daily/2024-09-07) could look like:

```
mod compare: { |T: type|
    fn max: { |a: T, b: T|
        if a b > then { a } else { b } end
    }
}
```

Please ignore the specifics of the syntax. Caterpillar doesn't have modules, nor
static types right now, so this is just a vague sketch of what that could look
like. No idea how exactly this would end up, if it makes its way into the
language.

What's important are the semantics: There's a module, `compare`, which is just a
function, executed at compile-time, that receives a type parameter. Within it,
there's a regular function, `max`, which is executed at runtime. Since all
functions in Caterpillar are closures, it can access its environment, which
includes the type parameter of the module.
