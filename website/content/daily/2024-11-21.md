My [rewinding example from yesterday](/daily/2024-11-20) has a lot of overhead.
A ratio of 5 undo instructions to just 3 regular ones! But it can be made
cheaper by going more coarse-grained. For example, the latter two instructions
`push 2` and `add`, as a unit, can be undone with `push 2` and `sub`, resulting
in a 1:1 ratio. And a single `pop` can undo all three together (1:3).

I'm not sure yet what to do with this insight. Maybe the developer should have
explicit control over how expressions are grouped into "undo units". Or the
compiler could decide, based on some set of rules I have yet to work out. Guided
by configuration that, for example, could limit the ratio of undo instructions
to regular instructions.

I don't know. But I think this is one of those cases that I can work out when I
actually get to it. And in any case, it's best to keep the initial
implementation simple; just log undo instructions per instruction.
