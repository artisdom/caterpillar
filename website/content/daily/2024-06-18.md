It's unlikely that Caterpillar will ever become mainstream. I mean, that's an
unrealistic expectation anyway. Very few languages are. But even if I put in all
the required work, and had all the necessary luck, and it gained a thriving
community; even if all those conditions were met, it probably still wouldn't
happen.

I have too many wild ideas. Too many experimental features that I want to try.
Add to that, that I'm not committing to backwards compatibility. I just don't
think that millions of developers from all over the world will jump on the
opportunity to work with a language like that.

And that's fine. Caterpillar doesn't need that many users to be successful. I
would consider it a success if, at a minimum, it becomes a good tool that I want
to use. Beyond that, I hope it can gain enough users and provide enough value,
that I can fund its continued development.
