The `comptime` feature in [Zig] is pretty interesting! It allows you to do some
neat things. Here's an example from Zig's documentation:

```zig
fn max(comptime T: type, a: T, b: T) T {
    return if (a > b) a else b;
}
```

It's a generic `max` function that works with any type that provides an `>`
operator. It's pretty similar to how generics work in Rust, but the type
parameter is more similar to a normal function parameter. There are more
interesting things you can do with `comptime` in Zig, but I wanted to show you
this example, as it gave me an idea.

I'm wondering, can Caterpillar go a step further and make type parameters even
less of a special thing? Like, make them completely normal function parameters,
no special syntax or keyword required? And on top of that, maybe create a more
natural separation between compile-time and runtime parameters?

I think the answers to all those questions might be "yes". I have an idea, and
I'd like to tell you about it tomorrow.
