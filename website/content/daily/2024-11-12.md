Caterpillar programs are [embedded into a host](/daily/2024-07-02), which
provides platform-specific capabilities. These capabilities take the form of
functions. The compiler can recognize that an identifier refers to a
host-provided function, and compiles that into an instruction (the runtime is,
as of now, a bytecode interpreter) that triggers a special "host" effect.

This effect returns control to the host, which can then inspect the runtime's
stack to figure out which function is being called, and what its arguments are.
It occurs to me that this basically works like a classic system call interface.
Like what a regular userspace program would use to talk to the operating system
kernel.

I'm saying _classic_ system call interface, because there have been newer
developments in this field. On Linux, we have [io_uring] now, which enables
submitting system calls in bulk, without copying, and in an asynchronous manner.
I wonder if this approach is applicable to Caterpillar's host interface.
