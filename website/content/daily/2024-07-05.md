Caterpillar will be a functional language. There are many ways to define and
explain this, but here's my favorite perspective: Everything that your code does
is locally visible. So if you look at a piece of code, you won't be surprised by
its behavior. All it _can_ possibly do, is encoded in its arguments and return
values.

This is not just good for your, the developer's, understanding of the code. It
also helps the machine. I've [mentioned rewinding](/daily/2024-07-03) before,
but there are other cases where this is useful. A compiler or interpreter can
look at a piece of code, and immediately decide what can be run in parallel, for
example.

I've been talking about [tracking I/O](/daily/2024-07-04), and this is what I
mean by that. If I/O is to happen, it can't just be hidden inside of a function.
It must be visible outside of that function. In its signature, ideally even in
the code that uses it. There are multiple ways of achieving that though, and I'd
like to talk about those over the next few days.
