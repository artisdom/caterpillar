So let's assume that in the future, the compiler
[annotates functions](/daily/2024-12-07) with the effects they could trigger.
Let's also assume, we make that useful somehow, maybe with
[dependent types](/daily/2024-12-09). I [implied earlier](/daily/2024-12-07),
that there's more we can do with effects, so let's take a look at that today.

What I'm going to talk about here are "algebraic effects". What that basically
means (according to my limited understanding), is that effects become a
first-class concept in the language. Something that the developer can define and
handle themselves. As opposed to all effects being built into the language, and
handled only by the host.

Allowing that has some profound consequences. Remember, effects stop execution
and turn over control to a handler (currently the host), which can then resume
execution after doing whatever else, or not. This is a very powerful ability,
that can be used to implement features like exceptions, async/await, and many
other things, without any special support from the language.

Starting tomorrow, I'd like to dig into that further.
