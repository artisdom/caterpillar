Before I go into [pattern matching in function definitions](/daily/2024-08-10)
and the varied considerations that led me there, I want to interrupt the regular
flow with a short announcement.

I've started
[opening issues in the Caterpillar repository](https://github.com/hannobraun/crosscut/issues),
to document the current shortcomings. The target audience are both those
interested in using Caterpillar, so they know what they're in for; and those
interested in contributing, to suggest specific areas to work on.

If you're interested in getting involved, why not take a look and pick up one of
those issues? I'm always happy to help, so feel free to post questions in any of
them, if something is not clear.
