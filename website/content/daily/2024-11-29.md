The Snake game I wrote in Caterpillar is now
[available on the website](/games/snake/). It's not linked from anywhere else on
the website yet, nor does the page link to the rest of the website. I'll
integrate it properly at some point, but one thing at a time.

This is being deployed automatically on every change to the game, or to
Caterpillar. The automated testing, while not bad, isn't exactly perfect yet, so
I expect it to break from time to time. But whatever; gotta start somewhere.
