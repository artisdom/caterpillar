So, I need to [track the arity of every expression](/daily/2024-11-07) at
compile-time. And doing so is complicated, because of the `eval` intrinsic,
which has an arity that depends on the anonymous function it evaluates. I came
across this problem maybe a week or so ago (or was it 2, maybe 3? I can no
longer tell ðŸ˜‚).

The core problem here is, that the `eval` call not only needs to work where the
anonymous function is defined. You can also return the anonymous function from
where it was created, and then evaluate it elsewhere. If all you do is track
arity, you'll lose the information that you need to assign an arity to the
`eval` call, leaving the system with holes.

So you need to track which of a function's return values is an anonymous
function. But since anonymous functions can return other anonymous functions,
it's also not enough to just track the arity of those. At this point, I think it
becomes easier to forget about arity, properly define what a type is, and track
which types every expression consumes and produces. That's a static type system.
