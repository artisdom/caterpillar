I've been talking about
[the advantages of a content-addressed code database](/daily/2024-08-02). There
are a few more, but for various reasons, I'll just quickly gloss over them.

A content-addressed code database enables better tooling. Tools like formatters
or linters don't need to bring their own parsers. They can rely on the full
power of the compiler, as the pre-compiled intermediate representation is
available in the code database. I'm sure I'll have more to say about tooling in
the future, so I won't speak on it any further here.

[Unison] offers built-in support for distributed programming and typed durable
storage. Both are super-interesting, but they don't fit Caterpillar's current
focus. Maybe one day! Finally, content-addressing is very useful to implement
interactive programming, which is very relevant for Caterpillar. I'll surely go
into that more deeply, as I re-implement it in the current version.
