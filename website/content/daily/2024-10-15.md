Let's switch gears and think about maps for a second. It's totally reasonable to
store your data in one of those, and just refer to it indirectly, via some kind
of handle that is associated with a value in the map. It's also reasonable to
expand on that. Create a special map that generates a handle for you when you
insert something.

Maybe such a special map could even implement a strategy for managing handles
and values. Like making handles unique, and requiring you to return the unique
handle to the map when you're done with a value. Or keeping track of which
handles exist, and when the last one for a value is dropped, remove that value
from the map.

Suddenly, those special maps start to sound like heaps, plus a strategy for
managing the memory there. But neither of those would be built into the
language. They could very well be implemented in a third-party library. So
[maybe Caterpillar will have references after all](/daily/2024-10-14). They
might just come in the form of handles into various maps.
