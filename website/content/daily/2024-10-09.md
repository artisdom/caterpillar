The [new function syntax I'm considering](/daily/2024-10-05) would require new
keywords (`fn` and `end`), and thus prevent those names from being used for
functions. This is a general problem with keywords, at least those that can't be
restricted to a specific context. In this case, both keywords could show up in
the same contexts as function calls.

But what if keywords had a special syntax? Like `@fn`/`@end`, for example. At
first glance, this seems too ugly and visually noisy for something so pervasive.
But the editor would do syntax highlighting anyway, making the `@` redundant. It
could just omit it. Or render it so small as to not hinder readability, while
still making it discoverable.

Also consider, that the editor could provide hints and auto-complete. If you
type `if`, it could offer to insert the keyword for you. Taken together, this
would make the `@` more like a hotkey for typing keywords, less part of the
syntax.
