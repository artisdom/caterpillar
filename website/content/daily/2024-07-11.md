[Speaking of Rust](/daily/2024-07-10), why do we need this business with linear
types anyway? Why not just have something like `Drop`, which is Rust's
implementation of destructors?

Destructors can work in many cases, but what if the destructor needs to do
something that returns an error? Where would that go? What if the destructor
needs to call an operation that's `async`? Those are real problems in Rust.

But it's not a problem with linear types. The compiler forces you to do
_something_ with a value. But what you do, where you do it, what resources you
use to do it; that's up to you.
