Yesterday, I [presented an example](/daily/2024-12-20) that combines linear
types and multiple effects. Here it is again:

```
file
	"a" write
	"b" write
```

`write` is going to trigger some kind of effect that signals the host that it
needs to write to a file (let's call that `Write`). In principle, the host could
decide not to resume this code after handling the effect, and if that happens,
our linear value here (`file`) would have nowhere to go. But it's _linear_, so
it _needs_ to go somewhere. We can't just drop it implicitly.

I think this can be solved by expressing in the type system, that the code
_must_ resume after the `Write` effect. The host could still not do it, but the
host could mess up in any number of ways that language design can't prevent. Any
Caterpillar code handling that effect could be forced to always resume, by the
compiler. The drawback is the additional complexity this introduces.

Tomorrow, I'd like to look at the second effect that `write` could trigger, in
the case of an error.
