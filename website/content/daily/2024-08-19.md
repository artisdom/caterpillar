I'm interrupting the current presentation on control flow for some breaking
news: Caterpillar has a syntax now!

I chose to go with the example syntax I've [been using](/daily/2024-08-17) over
the last [few days](/daily/2024-08-18) for a start. Nothing's final (ever), and
I expect to iterate on this further.

If you want to see a larger example, check out the
[Snake source code](https://github.com/hannobraun/crosscut/blob/3ce871850e574b31db06ff4a344bd43a9781a108/games/snake/snake.capi).
It could use some better formatting (and overall polish), but is already a big
improvement over
[the old code](https://github.com/hannobraun/crosscut/blob/5a73b7972acf4193fcf8716b26be3e7fa40a4730/games/snake/src/main.rs#L22-L1247)
that was hosted in Rust.
