I've been talking about
[rendering data as more than just text](/daily/2024-09-17). Let's imagine a
function that helps us do that. Not sure what its name should be, but for the
sake of this discussion, let's take inspiration from Rust and call it `dbg`.

This `dbg` function would be a no-op in production, but if a development
environment is attached, it would send the data there. The editor, when
displaying a function with `dbg` calls, would make space for the output from
those, next to the code. Basically, if you opened a function, you'd
automatically open a dashboard for the function at the same time.

In addition to development, you could use this mechanism for creating an ad-hoc
UI for your program. Not something you'd ship to users, but for personal
software? A quick simulation, maybe something you'd otherwise use a spreadsheet
for; why not?
