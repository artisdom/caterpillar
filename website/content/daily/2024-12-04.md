The approach I introduced yesterday should be
[a good baseline](/daily/2024-12-03), but to make rewinding truly good, there
are more things to consider.

First off, we don't _have to_ handle all events in a special way. Some events
can be undone, just like instructions, if we've logged the data required to do
that. An example of that would be writing to memory (which, for Caterpillar,
counts as I/O). Another could be sound effects, which you probably could just
ignore, or if you want to get fancy, play backwards when undoing them.

Graphics are interesting. In a typical game, you have many small operations that
draw things, but you don't actually show any of that until the end of the frame,
when you present the whole thing at once. Rewinding more than a few frames might
not be practical, due to memory use. And it would be better to show the results
of every single draw call anyway. Sounds complicated, but also worth doing.
