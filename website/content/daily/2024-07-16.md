Caterpillar is, as of right now, untyped. This means there is only a single data
type supported by the language, 32-bit numbers, that represents any value you
might need. A 2D vector, for example, is just two such numbers, and there is no
mechanism that would prevent you from mistaking half of that for, say, the
player's score.

This is not some far-reaching design decision. It's just how it works right now.
Because I had to start somewhere, and anything else would have been harder. For
the time being, it makes the most sense.

At some point in the not-too-far future, I want to switch to strong, dynamic
typing. That way, you at least get an error at runtime, if you make a mistake.
From there, I want to make the language gradually typed, until eventually, it
becomes fully statically typed.
