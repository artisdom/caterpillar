Before I continue with the train of thought I
[started yesterday](/daily/2024-10-22), I got two quick updates.

First, I wrapped up work on code updates for now. The
[second round of compiler cleanup](/daily/2024-10-13) was successful. At the
end, the bug became very obvious. There are still
[quite a few problems](https://github.com/hannobraun/crosscut/issues/50#issuecomment-2429611478)
with the current implementation, but nothing I'm inclined to address right here
and now.

Second, I ended up implementing the syntax changes I've been thinking about
recently. [Functions now start with `fn` and end with `end`](/daily/2024-10-05),
and [branch parameters are now delimited with commas](/daily/2024-10-08).
