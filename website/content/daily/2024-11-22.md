The approach of [logging "undo instructions"](/daily/2024-11-20) to get the
ability to rewind the program won't work as described, if implemented in the
current runtime. The problem is that executing instructions is currently not
atomic. For example, the `add` instruction might pop its first argument from the
stack, before noticing that there is no second argument left.

If we don't take this into account somehow and log instructions to undo the
partially executed instructions, rewinding won't work from such a state. Which
is relevant, because hitting some kind of error condition is probably going to
be one of the prime reasons to want to rewind in the first place.

It's unclear to me how big of a problem this actually is. Once static typing is
implemented, the case I described here can't happen anyway, because the compiler
would notice the missing argument and not generate the `add` instruction in the
first place. But still, it would be nice to just never have to worry about this
causing any potential problems. I'll have thoughts on that tomorrow.
