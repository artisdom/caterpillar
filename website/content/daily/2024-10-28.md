Here's my theory of game development as a target market: It's very hard to come
up with completely new game concepts. Therefore most games will, at least in
some ways, be similar to existing games, and thus appeal to the same audience.

To compete with existing games, a new game needs to differentiate. Most of the
ways it could do that are production values that are going to tax the underlying
technology. Any tools that target game development as a use case have to contend
with that fact.

And any such tool that is new and underfunded (all of which applies to
Caterpillar, [at least right now](/daily/2024-10-22)) will have a hard time
doing that. Which means it would initially be restricted to use cases that do
not require much competition, locking it into a hobbyist audience. This can be a
difficult position to be in.
