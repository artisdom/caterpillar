So yeah, I kinda couldn't control myself and
[mostly implemented type inference](/daily/2024-12-26) over the last few weeks.
This wasn't exactly the highest priority, given all those bugs in the debugger,
but I think that's fine. I'm not as intent on quickly getting to a state of
productive use as I used to be.

For a while, I was focused on that very consistently. That was very good for the
project, but I haven't been able to keep it up. Since then, things in my life
have shifted a bit, affecting the relative importance of Crosscut versus other
projects. I can't focus on it as much as I used to.

I still want to make progress every day though, and the easiest way to do that,
is to work on what excites me. Which is certainly not the most effective way to
make progress, but as long as things move in the right direction, I'm happy with
that, for now.
