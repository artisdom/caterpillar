What does it take to handle code updates, based on
[my latest insights](/daily/2024-10-02)? Since recursion is the only form of
iteration in Caterpillar, there's actually no need to update code within
functions. It's enough to upload new versions of functions that have changes,
and update any calls to them. They will execute the new code next time around.

We still might want to implement [a more detailed approach](/daily/2024-09-29)
at some point, to get a more immediate reaction to the update. But remember,
this is not [the ideal solution](/daily/2024-09-26) that I want to sink a lot of
time into. It's just a stopgap. Plus, it might turn out that replacing functions
is just good enough in practice.

So that's the first iteration that I'm going to implement: Detect which
functions have code that changed; re-compile those functions and append the new
instructions at the end; update all calls in existing code. Then
[iterate on that](/daily/2024-10-01) as necessary. Sounds doable; let's see how
it goes!
