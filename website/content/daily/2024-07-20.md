Yesterday [I alluded to](/daily/2024-07-19) doing what Rust does, automatic
memory management without runtime overhead, but without most of the complexity.
Turns out [I wrote about this before](/daily/2024-04-10).

Looks like I've been doing this long enough to repeat myself! I was totally
ready to launch into a whole series on how I'd like to simplify Rust's approach
to memory management. But since it seems I already put everything I was going to
say into a few lines, I can talk about something else now.
