If your Caterpillar application has performance-intensive parts, it could make
sense to [implement those in Rust](/daily/2024-11-14), as part of the host. At
least for the foreseeable future. The same goes for code that needs libraries
written in other languages, as Caterpillar currently does not have an FFI
interface.

In such a scenario, it could make sense to use ring buffers for communication
between host and Caterpillar code, especially if a lot of data is exchanged. If
you have multiple worker threads on the host side, to process requests in
parallel, then something like a [disruptor] could make sense.

But as of now, all of this is speculation. No applications that would benefit
from something like it have been written. So while it's interesting to think
about this stuff, I remain focused on more immediate goals. Like the static type
system, and then deploying games to websites (and I still think it should
actually be the the other way around ðŸ˜‚).
