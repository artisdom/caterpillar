Here's another thing about
[storing a pre-compiled representation of your code in a structured database](/daily/2024-09-10):
You don't have to retain any formatting information from the original plain text
representation, which means that all formatting can be automatic.

In language ecosystems where automatic formatting is widespread, it is typically
well-regarded. I myself, after being a critic for a time, have come around to
see its advantages and would not want to do without it. But a code database goes
one step further: There is _only_ auto-formatting. You can't avoid it, unless
you somehow edit the database directly.

A side effect of this approach, is that formatting only happens locally, on
demand. Everybody could work with the same code, using their own preferred
formatting rules, and it would just work. We could even have completely
different syntaxes for the same language, if we wanted.
