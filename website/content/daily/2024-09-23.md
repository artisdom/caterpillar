After making [the latest tweak to the syntax](/daily/2024-09-22), I realized
that with a [code database](/daily/2024-07-29), this wouldn't even be a breaking
change.

The _rendering_ of existing code would change, but that would just happen on the
fly. And the input format for new code would be different, although a potential
custom editor could accept both syntaxes as input for a while.

Sure, this would still be something that needs to be communicated to and
understood by developers. But nobody would need to go into existing code to
migrate it.
