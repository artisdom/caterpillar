As I said yesterday, Caterpillar is currently very confusing and hard to use.
I've run into this problem with many previous prototypes. It seems you just need
a critical mass of language features that promote clarity, until you cross some
threshold where the language becomes productive.

But what if I have tooling that tells me exactly what's going on at runtime?
Will that, by itself, make an otherwise confusing language practical to use?
This is not a ridiculous thought, I think. People write non-trivial stuff in
assembly languages. Presumably, at least in some cases, with the help of
debuggers.

I'm wondering if developing a debugger first is a more practical path to
productivity, than reaching this critical mass of features. If so, I could have
a usable language from early on, and could take my time expanding it. Only
adding features incrementally, as I deem it necessary and appropriate. But I
need to figure out if this approach can work, and that's the focus of the
current prototype.
