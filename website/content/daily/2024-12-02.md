There's quite a bit of [overhead](/daily/2024-12-01) to making rewinding work. I
think that's unavoidable, since immediacy is the central theme of Caterpillar,
and _"I ran into an error; have to set a breakpoint earlier, then restart and do
the same things that led to the error, for a second time"_ is not very
immediate.

But we shouldn't need to pay for the full overhead in every single situation. As
I've noticed before, the overhead [can be reduced](/daily/2024-11-21)
significantly, by undoing groups of expressions as a unit, instead of supporting
that for every single expression, one by one. But I think it's fine to have the
full overhead during development, for the code you're currently editing.

Other code maybe doesn't need to be undo-able in as fine-grained a manner,
although how to decide that specifically is still an open question. Maybe for
third-party code, it's good enough (by default) to only undo a whole function
call into that third-party code as a unit. And it should be possible to turn the
feature off completely, in cases where you need all the available performance.
