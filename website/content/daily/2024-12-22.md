Over the last few days, I've been analyzing [an example](/daily/2024-12-20) that
combines linear types and effects:

```
file
	"a" write
	"b" write
```

Yesterday, I looked into [the `Write` effect](/daily/2024-12-21). Today, I'd
like to take a stab at the second effect this could trigger. Let's call that one
`Error`.

If an I/O error happens while writing to a file, then the code doing the writing
could handle the `Error` effect and react appropriately. If it doesn't handle
the `Error` effect, and some caller up the chain (maybe the host) does, I think
it's safe to assume that this caller shouldn't resume the code triggering the
effect.

That means we need to take care of `file`, by putting it into the error (as a
payload), so whoever handles that can take care of disposing or re-using it.
`write`, which gets control over `file` anyway, could take care of that under
the hood. So it wouldn't be a problem in this case. But it would be a problem,
if there are other linear types in scope, that are unrelated to this error.
