I believe it is rather simple (which doesn't mean easy!) to create a
differentiated product for a business market: You pick a niche audience, figure
out what problems they have, and then you build a product that solves one of
those problems in a more targeted and specific way than an established product
from a bigger player could.

Since problems in a business probably cost that business money, they tend to be
willing to [spend money to solve them](/daily/2024-10-29). Meaning you might be
able to charge a decent price for your product, regardless of whether it is
complex or was difficult to make (especially if you have expertise that makes
the product hard to replicate for someone else).

Add to that, that in a hardware product, firmware only constitutes part of the
overall complexity (next to the actual hardware and possibly other software),
and you can suddenly see how
[a new language for developing firmware](/daily/2024-10-24) could fit into such
a scenario. Even if it's a bit too new to support more sophisticated use cases.
