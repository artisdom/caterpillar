Let's move on from algebraic effects for now. There's more to say about it (I
still have lots of notes). And in fact, I just had a new idea that might change
things in this area completely. But let's leave that for later. Instead, I want
to talk about a topic that I avoided dealing with for a while now. Probably
because it's scary and not urgent, which is never a good combination ðŸ˜„

**Caterpillar needs a new name!** I like the current one, and it was great while
this was just a little side project. But as I was getting more serious about it,
I've started thinking about [existing brands](https://www.caterpillar.com/),
domain availability, and other concerns. This was a protracted process that is
now over, so I won't go into it.

Instead, let's just get to the point: **The new name is Crosscut.** It's an
English word that's easy to say, write, and remember for many people worldwide.
As best I can tell, there are no trademarks that could get me into trouble. And
I already found a domain that I like. It also means "shortcut" (among other
things), which fits, since its kinda what I'm going for with this language.
