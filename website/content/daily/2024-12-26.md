After about a month, I think it's time for another development update! So,
previously I declared that I was going for
[type annotations over inference](/daily/2024-11-27), on every single
expression. Very tedious, but a safe baseline. Well, that didn't work out ðŸ˜„

I added support for optional type annotations to the parser, and started
annotating the code of the [Snake game](/games/snake). And yes, this was _very_
tedious, so I figured, hey, why not implement a tiny bit of type inference to
ease the load. Some cases are easy, after all. After that, I kinda never
stopped. And now, weeks later, type inference is almost complete!

Making a second go at it, I (of course) benefited from the first failed attempt.
I'm currently working on one more bug, and once that is addressed, it _should_
be complete, except for two cases: generic functions and divergent functions.
Each would require extensions to the type system that I don't want to take on
right now, so there will still be type annotations in those situations.
