I've been talking about changing binding _statements_, which modify the current
scope, into binding _expressions_, which
[create a new scope](/daily/2024-06-28). But there's a disadvantage to that
technique.

What if, within the scope that your binding created, you need to create more
bindings? Then you have a scope within a scope. Which could create another
scope, and so on. If this nesting goes to deep, surely that will offset any
advantage you get from not modifying the current scope.

I guess you can alleviate this by keeping your functions short, which seems like
a good idea anyway. And there's probably lots to be learned by studying how this
kind of thing is handled in languages like Haskell. Either way, I think this
might be something I need to test for a while in Caterpillar, to see how it
works out.
