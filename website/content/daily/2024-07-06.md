So, how do you track I/O in a functional language? [Haskell] does it by encoding
I/O operations into a monad. (If you don't know what a monad is, then for the
purpose of this discussion, just think it as a container for data that describes
a series of I/O operations.) That monad is returned to the runtime, which
executes the operations.

I think I understand why Haskell does it like that, but it's not how I want to
do it in Caterpillar. Instead, I want to represent anything that can do I/O
(like a file, for example) as values. A function that writes to a file needs to
take the value representing that file as an argument, and return an updated
version, which represents the file after it's been written to.

That way, the developer, the compiler, or the runtime, can clearly see the file
value going through that function. I think this requires linear (or affine)
types though, and that's probably the reason Haskell uses the (seemingly) more
complicated monad-based technique. (I don't have enough room left to explain
linear types today, but I'm sure I'll get to them sooner or later.)
