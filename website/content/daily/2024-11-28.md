Anyway, I have a [Caterpillar CLI tool](/daily/2024-11-27) working now. It can
start a development server to run your game, including the debugger. And it can
export just the game (no debugger) as a static web page. From here, it should be
relatively easy to ship this tool as a standalone CLI application, but I don't
intend to look into that until I see some demand.

My next goal is to deploy the Snake game to the Caterpillar website (and set up
automation to always automatically deploy the latest version). But before I do
that, I want to look into optimizing the size of the WebAssembly module that
includes the runtime and game engine. Right now, it's 14 MB large, which is just
unnecessary.
