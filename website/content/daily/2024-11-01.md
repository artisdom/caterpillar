Over the last 1.5 weeks or so, I've been looking at Caterpillar from a
[business perspective](/daily/2024-10-22). And from that angle, it seems like
[game development is a difficult market](/daily/2024-10-29), while
[firmware development might make a lot more sense](/daily/2024-10-31).

And I haven't even been covering all that's relevant. For example, firmware
development as a use case for Caterpillar could tie very well into a service
offering that shares the same audience (small businesses developing hardware
products) and technical underpinning
([Embedded Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/what/embedded)).

And yet, I think I've convinced myself to stay focused on game development, for
the time being. Because, while a switch to firmware development seems like a
very good idea, I can't think of a compelling reason for why that switch needs
to happen _right now_. There's [a cost to switching](/daily/2024-10-26), as well
as [benefits to staying the course](/daily/2024-10-27).
