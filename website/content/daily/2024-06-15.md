Yesterday, I mused whether building a debugger was necessary, and if the same
amount of work, applied to other features, would have gotten me a better result.
I don't know. And I doubt that spending 2-3 months to start a new prototype from
scratch, to answer that question, is worth it.

Whatever the answer is, it's undeniable that the debugger is useful. It's also
undeniable that it opened my mind to the possibilities of custom tooling. I now
firmly believe that more of that is in Caterpillar's future. But when is the
right time to invest in it? That is the big question.

For now, I'll just move on with the current debugger, incrementally improving it
where it makes sense. But I have to be careful not to get caught up in sunk cost
fallacy. If the language grows less reliant on a debugger, and that debugger
becomes a burden, I might need to scrap it for the time being.
