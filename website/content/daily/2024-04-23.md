I've been talking about how to step through Caterpillar programs, forward and
backward, undoing and redoing changes to their state. But so far, I've
completely glossed over the topic of I/O. How would that interact with such a
capability?

Graphics are typically re-rendered every frame, based on the current frame. So
it wouldn't matter in that case. File I/O could work, if instructions/events
carry enough information to rewind changes there too. With a log file, you could
acknowledge the rewind by logging a message about it, then just continue from
there.

What's not at all clear to me, is how to hook I/O into this whole system in the
first place. It seems pretty straight-forward on the instruction level. But what
about Event Sourcing? That's designed to explicitly _not_ do any I/O when
applying events. More to think about, for sure.
