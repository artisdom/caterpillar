Anyway, [Caterpillar's approach to compiler errors](/daily/2024-09-05) is still
very experimental. And that's reflected in the developer experience. Right now,
there isn't even a centralized list of compiler errors and other problems
anywhere (tracked in [#26]).

Usability will improve over time, and we'll see how this approach works out. But
I think it's promising. And in the context of Caterpillar, with its focus on
(and design decisions made around) tooling, maybe essential.
