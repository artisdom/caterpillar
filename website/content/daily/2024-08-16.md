I think pattern-matching functions (and all functions in Caterpillar are
pattern-matching, strictly speaking; I'm just being explicit) have the potential
to be the basic primitive that all other conditionals are based on. Since
recursion is already the only form of iteration, that would make functions the
only control flow primitive.

I'm currently in the process of removing all other conditionals from the
language, to see what pattern-matching functions feel like in practice. But I
expect to add back other flow constructs, like `if` or pattern matching
expressions, over time. But then purely as syntax sugar for pattern-matching
functions.

I think having only one concept, pattern-matching functions, as the foundation
of all control flow, is elegant, makes for a simpler implementation, and is
hopefully easy to comprehend. You only really have to understand one concept.
And if you see an unfamiliar control flow construct, you just have to look up
how it maps to that one concept you already know.
