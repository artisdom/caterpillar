I've been talking about binding _statements_ versus binding _expressions_ for a
few days now. Both bind operands to names. Bindings _statements_ do so by
modifying the current scope:

```
# Compute a sum and bind it to the name `sum`.
a b + => sum .

# `sum` can from now on be used in this scope.
sum sum *
```

Binding _expressions_ create a new scope, in which you can use the new bindings:

```
# Compute a sum and bind it to the name `sum`.
a b + => sum {
    # This is a new scope. We can access `sum` here.
    sum sum *
}

# The binding is an expression, so it returns the result of the inner scope. We
# can use that here, by chaining more operations. Or, if the function ends here,
# the result is returned to the caller.
```

The former represents a more imperative style, the latter a more functional one.
Caterpillar will definitely be a functional language, but that doesn't mean it
needs to blindly mimic everything that other functional languages do.

Whatever the solution ends up being, it needs to make sense _for Caterpillar_.
Rust, for example, provides support for functional programming, but does pretty
well with a more imperative stance on these things. I don't want to blindly
mimic that either. It's another data point.
