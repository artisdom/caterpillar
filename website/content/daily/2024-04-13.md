Yesterday, I talked about the platform concept that I'm stealing from [Roc].
That concept doesn't just improve portability. It's also good for security.

If every I/O primitive that a library can use must be passed as an argument,
that means you know exactly what a given library can do. It won't just access
the filesystem and read your data unexpectedly. And you can further increase
security by making access more fine-grained. Pass a limited instance of the
filesystem interface, that just allows access to the specific directory that you
expect a library to write to.

And by treating access to heap memory as an I/O primitive, as I intend to do in
Caterpillar, you can even apply this concept to memory safety.
