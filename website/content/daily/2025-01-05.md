If input code and rendered code [don't need to be the same](/daily/2025-01-04),
then you can optimize each for its purpose. For example, one might decide that
significant whitespace is best for readability, but still might not want it in a
language, because it could be harder to write. With a code database and a custom
editor, we wouldn't have to make that trade-off.

Rendered code could use whitespace to show how code is structured. Or it could
use other means to highlight that structure, like drawing boxes. We could go
totally crazy and render code as a control flow graph. At that point, the border
between traditional (text-based) and visual programming is pretty fuzzy.

And likewise, we could optimize the input code for its respective purpose. I'm
not claiming that the example I presented yesterday is the right way to do it.
But generally speaking, the characters that we actually type, would not need to
unambiguously define the code. Only the whole input stream, consisting of
characters, other keys, touch gestures, or whatever else, would need to.
