Caterpillar will be a purely functional language, which means everything you
really need to know about a piece of code, you can see by looking at it. If that
code calls a function, you can be sure that the function doesn't implicitly
update some global state. Everything that function can do, is encoded in its
parameters and results.

A side effect of that, is that it should be quite easy for the compiler to
parallelize code automatically. Take any piece of code and exploit its inherent
concurrency by compiling to machine code that runs on multiple threads. But if
the compiler does that, it gets harder for the developer to understand the
runtime behavior of their application.

But what if auto-parallelization happens in the pre-compilation step that
produces the canonical representation? Then the already parallelized code will
be stored in the code database. The developer sees exactly how the code will
run, can tweak the auto-parallelization parameters to influence the result, or
overrule a decision outright.
