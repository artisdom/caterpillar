So maybe, based on [my arguments from yesterday](/daily/2024-10-26), it makes
sense to stay with game development for the time being. To have a stable
platform for more improvements to the language and tooling, and to have an easy
way to show off those improvements to anybody who cares to see them.

And maybe, even if a focus on microcontroller firmware
[might make more sense overall](/daily/2024-10-24), it doesn't really matter
right now. With the current state of the project, I won't impress anyone either
way. So why not stay the course, make things work very well, and when the time
comes, switch over and start out strong on the other side?

That approach would come with some more subjective advantages too: I've
genuinely been looking forward to using Caterpillar to create small games, to
participate in game jams, to try out some techniques in the game engine, and to
learn more about GPUs. And it would be nice to have another creative outlet. If
that benefits the development of Caterpillar, all the better.
