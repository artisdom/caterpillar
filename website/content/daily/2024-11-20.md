The simple approach to expression-level rewind, implementing it
[in the runtime](/daily/2024-11-19), is pretty straight-forward: On every
bytecode instruction the runtime executes, it also logs "undo instructions" into
an "undo buffer". If executed, those will undo the original instruction.
Rewinding just takes instructions out of that undo buffer and executes them.

But what specifically are these undo instructions? They could just be regular
instructions. For example, let's look at the expression `1 2 +`. Under the hood,
this would translate into the following instructions:

1. `push 1`
2. `push 2`
3. `add`

To undo a "push" instruction, we'd just need to remove the value that was
pushed. So after executing instructions 1 and 2, the undo buffer would contain
"`pop`, `pop`". This is an easy case, because _every_ `push x` instruction would
be undone by `pop`, regardless of what `x` is.

The `add` is a bit more complicated. We need to know about its inputs and
outputs to undo it. But since we're talking about doing this at runtime, we have
all that information. We can undo the `add` with something like `pop` (to remove
the output), `push 1`, `push 2` (to reconstruct the inputs).
