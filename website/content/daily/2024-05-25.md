My decision to focus on language improvements for a bit was a good move, I
think. I've already implemented bindings (which are commonly called "variables",
in imperative programming languages) and started to refactor some of the code to
rely less on stack operations.

This was surprisingly easy. And while all bindings are currently mutable and
global, which is the opposite of what I'm going for, and they are not displayed
in the debugger, I think I have a good handle on how to address each of those
shortcomings.

For now, I'll continue refactoring the game code. Then I'll decide whether to
continue with language improvements, or move on with the original plan and
finish the game. Maybe bindings give me enough of a boost to power through. Or
it could make sense to further improve bindings, or implement modules.
