The new [comments on branches](/daily/2024-12-28) required changes to the
syntax. I want them to be associated with the branch in the syntax tree, so they
can be used to generate documentation, for example. Or, as I've already done, to
add metadata to branches for use in tests. Why did this require changes to the
syntax? Consider this example:

```
my_function: fn
    \ 0 ->
        0
        # This comment is part of the body of the first branch.

    \ 1 ->
        1
end
```

Versus this:

```
my_function: fn
    \ 0 ->
        0

    # This comment applies to the second branch.
    \ 1 ->
        1
end
```

The parser ignores whitespace, and it doesn't look ahead beyond the next token
it's going to process (the grammar is
[LL(1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser)). So it can't distinguish
between those two cases. To fix that, I required that branches end with `end`,
like functions:

```
my_function: fn
    \ 0 ->
        0
        # Now this comment can be clearly distinguished...
    end

    # ...from this other comment.
    \ 1 ->
        1
    end
end
```

I thought that having the `end` there made it look inconsistent, that branches
are started using an `\` token. So I replaced that with the new `br` keyword:

```
my_function: fn
    br 0 ->
        0
        # Now this comment can be clearly distinguished from...
    end

    # ... this other comment.
    br 1 ->
        1
    end
end
```

The new syntax still looks weird to me, but that's fine. I've come to realize
more and more, that everything I do syntax-wise before the
[code database](/daily/2024-07-29) exists, is temporary at best. But that's a
topic for another day.
