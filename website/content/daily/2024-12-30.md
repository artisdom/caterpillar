Traditionally, source code is expressed as plain text. This has the advantage
that we can use existing editors and version control tools to manage it. But
this plain text form requires a lot more processing, before it can be executed.

And not only that, it might also require a lot of processing before it can be
understood easily by the developer. A prime example of that is type inference.
Figuring out which type a given value has, might require a full understanding of
the surrounding code. But once type inference has happened, your tools can just
show this to you.

Modern development environments tend to do this by at least partially compiling
the plain text code, until they can provide this information and show it to you.
When you make a change to that plain text code, they compile it again (maybe
using a cache for parts that didn't change), and show you updated information.
It all starts with this plain text code. That's why it's called _source_ code.
