I need to come up with a way to
[reduce the initial scope of the algorithm that handles code updates](/daily/2024-09-27)
as much as feasible, in a way that allows me to refine it iteratively. Reason
being, that I don't want to waste any effort on making it better than it needs
to be, before it can be replaced by [something better](/daily/2024-09-26).

I'd like to talk about my idea for approaching the code update algorithm. But
before I can do that, I think I need to lay down some basics. First, the context
that the update algorithm exists in: Its output, and how that output is going to
be used. Then, some details about how code is represented in the Caterpillar
compiler, that should allow the update algorithm to do what it's supposed to.

The purpose of the code update algorithm is to determine which pieces of code
were replaced by other pieces of code. If you have some old code, `a b c`, and
new code, `a x c y`, then you'd expect the algorithm to output "`b` was replaced
by `x`" and "new code `y` added after `c`", or something along those lines.
Tomorrow, I'm going to explain what the compiler does with that information.
