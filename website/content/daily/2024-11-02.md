[I think I'll keep focusing on game development](/daily/2024-11-01) as a use
case for Caterpillar for a while longer. It is a perfectly suitable proving
ground for changes to the core language and tooling, and it's ready for that
right now.

It also gives me a creative outlet. I can develop games, participate in game
jams, experiment with a component graph system and geometric algebra in the game
engine, get more experience with GPUs, and more. All things that I'm looking
forward to doing.

Unless that results in an unexpected level of success, I anticipate that I'll
switch my focus to firmware development at some point. That doesn't mean it
won't be possible to develop games with Caterpillar anymore. I'll keep
maintaining that for as long as it makes sense. But my active efforts would
switch to helping the developers of hardware products.
