[That concept I presented yesterday](/daily/2024-07-14), about using linear
types for purely functional I/O, that's not really new. It feels kind of obvious
to me, but that's probably because the time is right for it. After all, Rust has
brought affine types into the mainstream.

I'm not sure if and where linear types specifically are used like this (I'm sure
_someone_ is doing it), but the general idea goes back to at least the late 80s,
with uniqueness types in [Clean].
