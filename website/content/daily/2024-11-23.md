Rewinding instructions is not trivial, because
[instructions are not atomic](/daily/2024-11-22) and can fail partway through.
Let's understand this a little better. Instructions look at the state of the
runtime, then decide how to change that. But the changes they can make are very
limited. Push a value, pop a value, set the address of the next instruction;
stuff like that.

Let's call those actions "micro-instructions". Micro-instructions are much
simpler than regular instructions. They don't decide anything; they just make a
change, independently of the runtime state. And there are fewer of them. Maybe
just a handful, versus currently 31 regular instructions (with more to come, I'd
guess).

So what if we log micro-instructions as undo instructions? Then we can undo
partially executed instructions just as easily. And the code that creates undo
instructions becomes much simpler, because there are far fewer
micro-instructions to consider.
