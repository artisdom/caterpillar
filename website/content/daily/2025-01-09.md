So, I've [started working](/daily/2025-01-08) on a new prototype. And if that
goes well, I will archive the previous one. After 8 to 9 months of working on
it, that previous prototype was a hot candidate for turning into the real thing
eventually. So why am I working on retiring it?

The general problem is that everything's taken longer than I thought it would.
And there's not really an end in sight. Part of the reason is that over the last
months, I've been going down rabbit holes instead of being laser-focused on
what's most important.

But that's only part of it, and I have a list of quite a few specific problems
with the approach I've taken on that prototype. Even if I strengthen my focus
(which I'm working), it would still take a long time before I can use that
prototype to participate in game jams semi-regularly, which I hoped I'd be doing
by now.
