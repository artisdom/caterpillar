The second reason that annotating functions with effects may be of
[limited use](/daily/2024-12-08), is that it would be noisy. Let's look at
division (the math operation) as an example. Dividing can trigger the "divide by
zero" effect. Any function that divides, or calls a function (maybe
transitively) that divides, could trigger the "divide by zero" effect.

For certain kinds of code, that effect would be everywhere. But annotating every
function with it would be useless. It would just be noise that tells me
_nothing_ about how well I'm actually dealing with the error. A solution to that
could be dependent types.

I'm not ready to fully dive into dependent types right now, but you can think of
them as types that include values. So instead of just saying `n: Number`, you
could say `n: Number and n != 0` . If you then divide `x` by `n`, you (and the
compiler) would know, that this can't trigger the "divide by zero" effect.
Sounds like that would make effects a lot more useful!
