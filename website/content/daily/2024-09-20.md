I'd like to note that the ideas I've presented here over the last few days
([[1]](/daily/2024-09-16), [[2]](/daily/2024-09-17), [[3]](/daily/2024-09-18),
[[4]](/daily/2024-09-19)), were influenced by things Richard Feldman mentioned
on [Software Unscripted], when talking about his plans for [Roc].

This inspiration came about in bits and pieces, over many episodes, and I can no
longer even tell which ideas were my own, and which I stole. So I don't have any
specific references here. But since the podcast is great, I recommend to listen
to it in its entirety anyway ðŸ˜„
