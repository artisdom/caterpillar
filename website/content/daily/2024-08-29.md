A while ago, [I hinted at](/daily/2024-08-10) some additional solution being
required to fully make conditionals work. The problem that this solution needs
to address is call stack reconstruction, specifically when
[involving multi-branch functions](/daily/2024-08-28). And this is what I'd like
to talk about today, finally.

So you're reconstructing the call stack. You suspect there's a gap, but the last
function you know of happens to have multiple branches. And if more than one of
those have tail calls, which are at the root of call graphs that lead to the
next known function in the call stack, then you can't know what is missing in
between.

You need additional information to reconstruct the call stack. And since the
situation I just described can be detected at compile-time, I think that the
compiler can provide that information, by arranging for hints to be left on the
call stack. I have some ideas for making that happen, which I'd like to talk
about tomorrow.
