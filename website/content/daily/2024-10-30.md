My work on Caterpillar currently focuses on supporting game development as a use
case. This makes a lot of sense in terms of the technical roadmap. Games are
inherently interactive and, by design, can make it hard to test specific parts
of them. They're also fun projects to work on.

But game development might not make a lot of sense from a
[business perspective](/daily/2024-10-22). I believe it is unrealistic to
[target professional game developers](/daily/2024-10-28) any time soon, and that
might make this market [too hard to survive in](/daily/2024-10-29).

I don't think these problems apply to [firmware development](/daily/2024-10-24)
in the same way. But since I'm not going to fit the reasons for that into this
last paragraph, that's a topic for tomorrow.
