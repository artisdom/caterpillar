Before I continue with my current series on the code database, a short update:
The [rename](/daily/2024-12-25) is all done now! I've updated the name
everywhere it needed to be updated (I think).

I also changed the domain name of this website to `crosscut.cc`. All the old
URLs should redirect (although I just found some issues that should get fixed
shortly). Let my know, if you see any problems!
