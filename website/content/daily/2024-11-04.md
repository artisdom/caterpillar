Some time ago, I talked about [stepping backwards](/daily/2024-04-18) in the
debugger, and how [event sourcing](/daily/2024-04-20) could play a role in that.
I also floated the idea of [a distinction between](/daily/2024-04-29) solid
code, that is highly optimized; and fluid code, which provides live interaction.

Now I'm wondering, can we combine both ideas? By default, you can step through
your code forward and backward, expression by expression. If you have a piece of
code that you need to run faster, you can tell the development environment to
optimize it, losing some interactivity.

But what if your code used event sourcing and the system understood how that
worked? Then this distinction between optimized "solid" and interactive "fluid"
code could be made along the boundaries set by the events. You could still step
backwards, just in a more coarse-grained manner; event by event.
