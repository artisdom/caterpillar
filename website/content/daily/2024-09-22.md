I've been doing a bit of light reading on other languages. Just snooping through
documentation and code samples. That inspired me to make a change to
Caterpillar's syntax.

Here's how function literals looked like, as of yesterday:

```
{
    |a 0|
        a

    |a b|
        a b +
}
```

The parameters of each branch were delimited by `|`. This was directly inspired
by [Rust] (which might have gotten it from [Ruby]).

As of last night, the same code looks like this:

```
{
    \ a 0 ->
        a

    \ a b ->
        a b +
}
```

Each branch now starts with a `\`, while a `->` introduces the branch body. This
is directly inspired by [Roc], but I've also seen it in [Elm] and [Futhark]. I
guess it's an ML-family thing.

I never quite liked how the same token was used on both ends of the parameter
list. Now the start of that and the start of the body each look unique.
