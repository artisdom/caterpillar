Caterpillar is currently using `{}` to delineate functions. Here's an example of
that:

```
{
    \ a 0 ->
        a

    \ a b ->
        a b +
}
```

This is a function with two branches. The first branch is executed, if the
second argument is `0`; the second branch is executed otherwise.

I'm thinking about replacing the braces with new `fn` and `end` keywords:

```
fn
    \ a 0 ->
        a

    \ a b ->
        a b +
end
```

In my opinion, this has two advantages:

- It is more obvious to the uninitiated. `fn` makes it relatively clear, that
  this is a function.
- It frees up `{}` for other uses.

But it would also introduce two new keywords, which then would not be available
as function names.
