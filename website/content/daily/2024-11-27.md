I've decided that a fully inferred static type system is
[not worth the trouble](/daily/2024-11-26) right now. I'll have another go at it
later, but then I'll (initially) require every single expression to be annotated
with a type signature. That's going to be bad, but from there, I can implement
type inference (and more complex type system features) incrementally.

But before I go there, I've finally started looking into deploying games written
in Caterpillar to a website. (Which should have been the highest priority for a
while now.) Of course, I already managed to get sidetracked. Instead of just
implementing deployment in a straight-forward way in the custom build tool for
the Caterpillar repository, I started working on a Caterpillar CLI tool.

That's not too bad. Going that route probably wasn't that much more work in the
end. And a tool for Caterpillar development, that you can use outside of the
Caterpillar repository, and without needing a Rust toolchain installed, is going
to be required anyway.
