Note that in relation to [compiler-orchestrated rewinding](/daily/2024-11-30),
I've been talking about "undo data" in addition to "undo instructions". In an
interpreted environment, just generating the instructions that undo the regular
instructions seems like the most straight-forward approach. But when compiling
to WebAssembly, I don't think this would work without jumping through hoops.

Generating static undo instructions at compile-time, and then at runtime just
filling a buffer with arguments for those static instructions, seems like the
more portable approach. I haven't tried it yet, but I'd guess that would work in
pretty much any compiled environment.

Seeing it laid out like this, it becomes very obvious that there's quite a bit
of overhead here. It kinda seems to not matter with an interpreter, since that's
slow anyway. (In reality, it still matters of course.) With compiled code, the
additional overhead can't be hidden. It's very obvious. But it can be reduced,
which is what I'd like to talk about tomorrow.
