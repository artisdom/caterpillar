I've mentioned my plan a few times, to not have references in Caterpillar. If
data is immutable, then semantically a reference is the same as a copy. The
compiler can optimize this, replacing copies with references under the hood,
where appropriate. With [pre-compiled code in a database](/daily/2024-07-29),
the result of that optimization can even be displayed explicitly.

That whole plan was very tentative in the first place, and I've just discovered
a new complication: What about recursive data structures? If a type refers to
itself, either directly or through a series of other types, you need a reference
in there somewhere. Having infinitely-sized types won't work!

And while I can easily imagine the optimization I've described above, especially
in the presence of a [linear type system](/daily/2024-07-09), I'm not sure that
something similar is feasible for recursive data structures. I mean, _maybe_ it
is, but wouldn't the correct optimization depend on how the type is _used_, not
how it's structured? That could get tricky.
