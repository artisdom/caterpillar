Caterpillar's host interface
[could be modeled after io_uring](/daily/2024-11-13). But would it made sense?
Not right now, as I already said. But I think there are scenarios where this
could become interesting.

The obvious use case would be the same kind of asynchronous and I/O-heavy code
that io_uring is already built for. Especially, if there's a separation between
a given host and the runtime. Maybe because the host runs on another thread. Or
even in another address space, acting like an operating system kernel.

But I think it could also make sense for compute-heavy code. For the foreseeable
future, Caterpillar will remain slow. At least compared to something like
[Rust], which it is implemented in. So it seems reasonable to implement a
performance-intensive part of your application in Rust, as part of the host. And
communication based on ring buffers could make a lot of sense in this case too.
