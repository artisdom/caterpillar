I've been making more progress on the game. It's recognizably a real Snake now!

In the meantime (I've made this video yesterday), I've also implemented randomly
spawning food (but the snake can't eat it yet).

Progress on the game has been accelerating lately. I think that's because the
language and tooling have reached a point where they are good enough (barely!)
to support a game of this complexity. Maybe I'll run into another hurdle, who
knows; but I think can power through now, and hopefully finish the game soon!
