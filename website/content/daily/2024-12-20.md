Yesterday, I talked about the
[disadvantages of algebraic effects](/daily/2024-12-19), starting with one that,
in the context of Caterpillar, was rather easy to refute. Today, let's look at a
problem that is giving me a bit more trouble: The interaction of effects with
[linear types](/daily/2024-07-09).

Remember, linear types force you to use a value exactly once. Meaning you can't
drop it implicitly, if it falls out of scope. This means you have to consider
such a value, whenever you might trigger an effect.

```
file
	"a" write
	"b" write
```

Here we have a value that represents a file (currently bound to the name
`file`), and write data to it twice. The `write` function would have a signature
like `File, Data -> File`, meaning it would consume the data, but return the
file again. That allows us to chain multiple calls, as I do here.

`File` would be a linear type, so Caterpillar can be
[purely functional](/daily/2024-07-05). But `write` could trigger effects! One
to signal the host, so it knows to actually write to the file. Another one, to
signal that an error occurred while doing so. Tomorrow, I'd like to show how
each presents a challenge for handling the linear type.
