I used to run the Snake game all the time during development, to test my
changes. I tended to forget to run the test suite, so sometimes I noticed it had
broken it at some point.

The test suite has grown significantly [since then](/daily/2024-07-27), and I've
come to rely on it for day-to-day development. Now I forget to test the game,
and sometimes notice I have broken that. Which just means that the test suite
needs to grow even more.

For now, things are fine as they are. But at some point, I need a real CI/CD
pipeline that also compiles (maybe even runs?) the available game code, to make
sure it is working. I want to be able to deploy changes to a release channel
right away, without the need for manual testing. And despite that, a high
confidence that nothing will break.
