So the game runs in the browser now. What comes next?

There are lots of problems I could address. Many features missing in the
language. Performance is also a big one. But there's another task I'd like to
focus on first: bringing back interactive programming.

I didn't include it, last time I started from scratch. It was working in
previous prototypes and, for the time being, I considered it a solved problem.
But with the game running in the browser, circumstances have changed. And adding
interactive programming later, _after_ I include other features that have to
coexist with it, would only get more and more difficult.
