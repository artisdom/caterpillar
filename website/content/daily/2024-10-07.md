The [hypothetical syntax that I presented yesterday](/daily/2024-10-06) does not
have any delimiters, like commas (`,`), to demarcate between different elements
in a list, tuple, or map. This has precedence in the current syntax. Branch
parameters are not delimited either.

I like the clean look this results in, but there are subtleties to consider.
Thanks to postfix operators and stack-based evaluation, it's possible to even
have more complex elements without ambiguity. Consider a list like
`[ a b 1 + ]`. This is semantically unambiguous when evaluating it left to right
(add `a`; add `b`; add `1`; then take `b` and `1`, add their sum).

But that doesn't mean it's a good idea. For one, it might be unambiguous, but
that doesn't mean it's clear. Without delimiters, this must be formatted using
whitespace to become readable. The other issue is _syntactical_ ambiguity. The
compiler can't make sense of this just by parsing it. It needs to run
type-checking, at least.
