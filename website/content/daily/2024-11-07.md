The Caterpillar runtime is a bytecode interpreter. (Right now. Eventually, I
want to compile Caterpillar directly to WebAssembly, and later machine code.) It
executes instructions that are generated by the compiler. Some of those
instructions are quite complicated, which is why the runtime
[requires dynamic allocation](/daily/2024-11-06).

I want to replace these complicated instruction with simpler ones, but that
means the compiler needs to do more work. Basically, the runtime tracks more
information than is strictly necessary, and this information is processed by
those complex instructions. My goal is to track that information at compile-time
instead, so no more complex instructions are required.

I started with bindings (what many languages call "variables"). I'd like to
eliminate that concept from the runtime entirely. To do that, I need to track
the arity (number of inputs and outputs) of every expression at compile-time.
But that is not as simple as it initially seemed, because the arity of the
`eval` intrinsic depends on the arity of the anonymous function it evaluates.
