A few days ago, I said that
[microcontroller firmware can't run on websites, or my phone](/daily/2024-10-26).
That's not completely true though. It could, if you simulated the hardware.

And I think that would be a _really_ cool thing to support. I imagine a
Caterpillar-based development environment for embedded systems, where you not
only write your software, but also create a simulated model, a digital twin,
alongside that. As part of the default development experience, supported by a
pre-made set of simulated components.

That would be awesome, but it's basically science fiction at this point. (As far
as Caterpillar is concerned. I'm sure there's other software that does this.)
It's definitely not something that can be achieved in the near-term, so it's not
really relevant for my [near-term decision](/daily/2024-11-02).
