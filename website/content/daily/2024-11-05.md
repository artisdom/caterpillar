The idea I presented yesterday about
[the interaction of event sourcing and compile-time optimizations](/daily/2024-11-04),
would require some level of integration between Caterpillar's tooling, including
the compiler, and an event sourcing framework.

The advantages of that are attractive, but
[there are disadvantages too](/daily/2024-04-22). We'll see how this develops.
I'm less concerned these days, about Caterpillar being seen as a general-purpose
language. It's a long-term goal, but there are problems to solve in the
meantime.
