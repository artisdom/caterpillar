As I've explained before, I'm using the development of a simple game to drive
the development of Caterpillar. I just posted about my progress on the language
and tooling side a few days ago. Thanks to that, I was able to make some
progress on the game side now.

(Sorry, I tried to embed the actual video, but GitHub wouldn't cooperate. You
can follow the link and download it instead. At some point in the not too far
future, all of this will hopefully move to a website, and then I'll have more
control over these things.)

Simple graphics, timed movement... only input is missing. We almost got a Snake
game here!
